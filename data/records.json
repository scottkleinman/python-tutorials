Go on, it's easy! Just slip your anonymous letter in the box stationed outside of his office and expect a reply within the week. No tampering with other's letters, please (this means you, Elladan and Elrohir!!)*~*\n\nDear Elrond,  I am an elf in love with a mortal. Whenever we talk about the future, he freezes up and refuses to talk about it. Not only am I starting to think I was just an easy lay, but I am so desperately in love despite the fact that our relationship working out is so improbable. My father is furious with the idea and, though I'd willingly give up my entire family, life and culture for this one man who will die in only a few short years, I don't know what to do.  Oh, and he is also my foster brother. But I don't really think that makes much of a difference.  Please help!  Uneven Star\n\n***  Dear Uneven Star,  You should immediately end your relationship with this man and forget you ever knew him. Go to Lothl\u00f3rien, put up your feet, relax a bit, and find a nice, suitable elf to marry (preferably of some level of nobility, though that isn't imperative).  Oh, and incest is frowned upon in even the darkest of societies, so it worries me that you don't find this to be a problem.  Lord Elrond\n\nDear Elrond,  I am only a floating, flaming eyeball, but I still have feelings. My minions forget about me all the time and I am often not invited to afternoon tea, despite the fact that I could keep said tea warm all evening. If they aren't neglecting me, they are having tournaments to see who can get closest to me without being burned or who can throw rocks directly in the center of my pupil. What can I do to stop this bullying?  OneRingToRuleThemAll\n\n***  Dear One Ring,  Have you sat down (or, er, hovered closer to the ground) to talk with your minions about what is bothering you? Perhaps they are frightened of you. You are, after all, attempting to take over Middle Earth and all of its inhabitants. Maybe if you weren't so powerful, they would be more inclined to include you in their fun; my advice is to destroy the one ring, implode all over Mordor, and have fun with your orcs.  Lord Elrond\n\nDear Elrond,  No matter where I go, whether it is to practice archery, dine in the main hall, or take a nice, relaxing walk in the gardens, I am constantly being followed by scary, American teenage girls. They giggle madly at everything I say and wear the most disgusting, revealing clothing! I am not interested in any of them but am too polite to refuse their advances (and, for Eru's sake, I am over 3,000 years old. Do they honestly think I would bond with a 14 year old?) and am truly becoming frightened of their insistence. Help!!  DesperateBlonde\n\n***  Dear Desperate,  If you stopped being so yummilicious and reeking of princely gorgeousness, perhaps the young ladies would retreat. Try refraining from bathing and washing for a few days and see if they can tolerate the smell. If that doesn't work, maybe you should  finally  pick a bride (because, honestly, Legolas, your father is desperate for grandchildren) and show all of Middle Earth that you are not interested in said frightening American adolescents.  If all of those don't work, you should locate Orlando Bloom, fashion him in your tunics and leggings, and send him into the heart of Mirkwood where he can be attacked by scary fangirls. Best of luck to you.  Lord Elrond\n\nDear Elrond,  I am desperately, passionately and madly in love with you. I have been for many years, and never had the courage to tell you. I know your wife is merely in Valinor, and you are going to see her in a few years and are still bonded with her, but if you were ever interested in dating again, I would be more than willing to oblige.  With all of my love,  Mirror Image\n\n***  Dear Mirror Image,  I am flattered by your confession, but, as you pointed out, I am happily married and not at all interested in dating again. I kindly suggest you try dating other elves, or perhaps buy yourself a nice cat to keep you company.  Lord Elrond\n\nDear Elrond,  I am only seventeen years old, but am faced with the task of finding five horcruxes in order to kill a mad wizard who is trying to take over the world. In addition to that, I am expected to decipher the rambling messages of my crazy old headmaster who died before being able to explain anything to me. How should I go about doing this?  Oh, and I have an awful scar on my forehead that everyone stares at, I don't have any parents to talk about my problems with, the girl I fancy is out of my reach and everyone I love ends up dying before they manage to convey anything of importance to me.  Please help!  TheBoyWhoLived\n\n***  Dear Harry (for there is no point in being discreet, no one in this world knows who you are anyways),  First, I would get the hell out of Middle Earth and return to your own story. You won't solve any of your problems by hanging around here. Second, maybe you should go talk to the portrait of your dead headmaster hanging in his old office and ask your questions.  Your scar can't be helped; you might as well live with it. (If you haven't gotten used to it by now, maybe you can try covering it up with some makeup. Just a dash of skin toned foundation and voila! Instant coverage.) I understand you have no parents, but don't you have about three dozen adults who would more than willingly fulfill your every wish?  And as for the girl you fancy being unattainable (which we all know isn't true for a stud-muffin like you) you should talk to Legolas, as I'm sure he would be more than willing to give you one or more screaming fangirls to take home with you.  Lord Elrond\n\nThis letter sent courtesy of C\u00edrdan, who is intercepting all advice letters from Valinor.\n\nDear Elrond,  I know you were not expecting me back, but I decided after much thought that my poisoned wound really wasn't  that  bad, and have returned to Middle Earth. If you would be so inclined as to return to our bedroom, take off your robes and greet me properly, I would be much obliged.  Sincerely,  Celebr\u00edan\n\n*** Lord Elrond's reply was cut short as he ripped off his clothing and ran from his office. Please stand by.\n"}

Yeah, okay. Looked like the gods of late-registration were determined to sacrifice her on the alter of unholy earliness this semester.  A Starbucks venti steamed under her chin, and her fingers wrapped around it for warmth. So far only she and one really nervous dark-haired guy had arrived for class. She'd been studiously ignoring the dude so far, but if he didn't quit staring at her soon, she was gonna pop.  Then a blond chick waltzed in, all decked out in an army surplus jacket and tall leather hiking boots. Her hair was a wild tangle, but Moira knew a half dozen guys who'd fall over themselves to get inside those gray-camo pants. Amazing how some girls could look luminous in absolutely no make-up and dirty fingernails.  \"Good morning,\" the blonde chick singsonged. She glanced around the near-empty classroom and raised one eyebrow. \"Is this the entire class?\"  Moira resisted glancing over at the dark-haired dude, but at least she didn't feel his gaze boring into her anymore. Whew. She took a sip of her tar-like coffee.  \"I guess. So far, anyway,\" she muttered.  The blonde shrugged and unzipped her backpack. \"Very well. My name is Dierdre,\" she said. \"I'll be your TA this semester. We will get started in a bit: Dr. Birdsong is usually a little late for these early-morning classes.\"  \"Wish I'd been,\" mumbled Moira. \"Could've used the extra sleep. Guess the prof ain't a morning person either. That's cool.\"  \"Morning pers ... ah. Well, as to that, Dr. Birdsong has a few morning rituals to perform before he begins his day,\" Dierdre said, shifting her gaze like it was a big mystery what the prof did in the morning. Probably something utterly stodgy and professorish, like doing the New York Times crossword or waxing his mustache. \"In the mean time, here's the syllabus and required reading.\" Dierdre fished deep in her backpack and produced some Xeroxes.  As she was passing out the papers, two more students filtered in: a petite Asian-looking girl and a guy wearing a heinous floppy fisherman's cap and a nappy orange sweater. The guy slid into the seat beside the nervous dark-haired kid in the corner, and they nodded to each other in that dorky chin-dip way some guys affected. They looked like thwo peas in a socially atrophied pod; Moira wasn't surprised that they knew each other, though. Geeks were like that.  \"Guess Dr B isn't here yet,\" said nappy-orange sweater.  \"Nah. Morning rituals 'n' shit,\" replied nervous dude, chewing on his nubby fingernail. Looked like he did that a lot.  Moira pretended to ignore them but wondered \u2026 it sounded like they knew something in advance about the visiting prof. Or they wanted to seem in the know. She absently waited for one of them to explain further. They didn't of course. Geeks were like that, too: Always bringing shit up and then not explaining about it.  Bopping between bored and irritated, Moira scanned the reading list, yawned, and then read it again. On the third try, some of the meaning slipped in past her dewy half-hangover.  \"We're reading the Klingon dictionary? Whatthefuh?\" Had she said that out loud? She expected the TA to be shocked or offended or something. About the last thing she expected was Dierdre's low chuckle.  \"Yes. I suppose the course description was kind of vague, mm? Dr. Birdsong is an expert on artificial language sociology. That is, the created worlds and peoples linked to made-up languages.\"  Uh huh.  The Asian girl exhaled loudly, kind of like a teen-chick at a boy-band concert. Moira caught herself before she rolled her eyes. She still wasn't ruling out dropping this class, but it wouldn't be a good move to make enemies, just in case she needed study partners later. For projects 'n' shit. A lifetime of anonymous public schools had taught Moira how to game this system, and she was something of an expert in that arena. Mentally she reviewed course offerings in this degree-plan slot and wondered if there was still space in upper-division physical anthropology...  \"You know, my major is Spanish, not made-up languages. This is definitely gonna count for my credits, right?\" Moira asked the TA. Because, dude, what good was it to wake up for an 8 a.m. class when it didn't count for your degree?  \"Um, I think so. The linguistics department is very open to this line of study,\" Dierdre explained. \"Some people in the field think it gives you some ways to structure the study of other languages, like\u2026\"  She might have gone on for-freakin-ever, but that's when Dr. Birdsong decided to show up, and Dierdre, like everyone else in the room, fell silent and stared as he walked over to the big desk in the corner and started unzipping his backpack.  He was hot.  Like-whoa, deep-fried, finger-lickin' hot. Platinum blond hair was braided down to his ass, and he wore soft, loose clothes and comfy-looking hiking boots. He was tall, probably about 6' 4'', and porcelain-doll beautiful.  Awake for the first time this semester, Moira decided that, damn-skippy she could wake up for an 8 a.m. class. And maybe even learn Klingon."}

Morrod, the\nhuge, black war stallion who had carried her all day for the last\nfour days, turned his face around as he had every evening upon\nhalting to snuffle into the girl's hair and lip her ear until\nIvoreth finally felt stable enough to turn and give his forehead a\nscratch. \"I love you too,\" she told the proud mount, \"I just\nwish riding you didn't make me ache.\"\n\n\"The more often you\nride, the more you'll get used to it, daughter,\" Ada told her as\nhe pulled out the small, silver flask of tonic that he'd given her\nat the end of each day's ride so far. The liquid inside tasted\nlike sun-ripened fruit, and Ivoreth savored the small sip she was\nallowed. Then, as he had every time they stopped either to rest or\ncamp for the evening, he held both her hands and led her in a small\ncircle until her legs could work without a stiff jerk.\n\nHe had been distressed\nwhen, at the end of the first day's ride, Ivoreth had been\ncompletely unable to stand. She remembered that he'd told her that\nshe'd be uncomfortable, but for her entire lower body to be  numb\nsurprised her and, she was sure, frightened her Ada. The end of each\nday since was a little better, but Ivoreth was genuinely looking\nforward to a time when she wouldn't have to think about climbing on\na horse's back again.\n\n\"I can do it now,\nAda,\" Ivoreth told him and took a few careful and painful steps\naway from his hold to demonstrate that she was once more able to move\non her own.\n\nAda nodded and turned\nback to his mount, untying and handing down to her the various\nclothing and foodstuffs bundles that needed to be removed before the\nsaddles could come away. He loosened the straps from the warhorse's\nbelly and lifted first the child's seat away from the larger saddle\nand then cleared Morrod's back completely, draping the saddles over\na fallen log nearby.\n\nAs Ada cared for\nMorrod, Ivoreth carried the bundles over to where the L\u00f3rien Elves\nwere already establishing a circle of stones within which they would\nbuild the evening's cooking fire. In the four days she had been on\nthe road with the Elves, it had become her task every evening to set\nup the sleeping blankets for her family; with hers closest to the\nfire, then Raini and then Celebriel \u2013 with Ada's blankets at one\nend and Elrohir's at the other to surround them. The bending and\nstretching involved in laying out the blankets properly helped get\nher muscles used to moving again, and she sighed as she straightened\nwhen the task was once more finished for the evening.\n\nShe could hear Elrohir\nplaying with Raini, as he usually did at the end of the long day's\nride, to get her ready to spend time on her feet. She looked away\nwith a sigh of remorse whispering through her lips before the\ndark-haired Elf could see her staring at him and turn away from her\nagain. She didn't blame him for his treatment \u2013 after all, he\nhad yet to forgive her for stealing from him and his punishment of\nchoice was a painful silence except for rare and curtly voiced orders\nto do something. He hadn't believed her to be so crippled at the\nend of the first day's ride, and his remarks \u2013 when Ada was\nnowhere close by \u2013 had been as sharp and painful as the reawakening\nmuscles themselves. But the number of ways she knew to do things for\nhim to try to win back his favor was running low, and the continued\ndistance between the two of them distressed her greatly. Every cold\nglance, every turned shoulder in her direction was as if Ada himself\nwere chastising her, and she was beginning to avoid Elrohir herself\nfirst now. If she stayed far away from him, his avoidance didn't\nhurt quite so much.\n\n\" Hiril n\u00een ,\"\na soft, Elven voice broke through her reverie. Ivoreth turned to\nfind Belegorn, the captain of the L\u00f3rien warriors, holding out a\npair of buckets. \"Be careful,  nethben , as the current of\nthe river here is very fast and strong.\"\n\nIvoreth nodded and\nwalked toward the Anduin to fetch water for the evening meal and\nperhaps a quick wash before bedtime. This, too, was becoming\nroutine. The Elves were efficient at setting up and breaking down\ntheir camp, and everyone but Raini had their accepted duties to\nfulfill to make the process run smoothly. Already Pilimor and Perdon\nstood at the edges of the river, poised to spear the evening's\nfare. Ivoreth chose a spot several paces away to dip first one\nbucket and then the other into a small eddy that had formed between\ntwo large rocks, knowing enough by now to not want to startle any of\nthe potential targets of the fisher-elves.\n\nThe place they had\nchosen to stop this evening was pretty, but then, everyplace they\nstopped to camp in or paused to rest the horses or even just passed\nthrough along the way was breathtaking to her. Nothing looked as\nsolid or cold as the stone streets and buildings of Minas Tirith; a\nfresh green stretched as far as the eye could see, which Ada had told\nher came only in the Springtime, when all of Nature was newly\nawakened and growing. She looked over the green grass to the trees\nbeyond and the purple-black shadow that Ada said were the Misty\nMountains that they would eventually have to cross. Such sights\nshe'd never dreamed of seeing only a few months earlier, when her\nentire world consisted of the interior of a large, stone cistern and\nthe back alleys of the lowest Circle of the City.\n\nWhat was more, the\nElves themselves were starting to confuse her. One moment they'd\nbe riding without hesitation or comment through or past a view that\nshe found so beautiful that she could almost forget to breathe, and\nthe next they'd be singing what sounded like hymns in soft\nharmonies that brought visions of green grass, dancing stars, and\ntall trees into the back of her mind. The most astonishing thing she\ndiscovered on this trip, however, was that Elves  glowed  \u2013\nespecially on cloudless nights. Even Ada glowed. For the first\ntime, Ivoreth understood that she was living with people very\ndifferent from her \u2013 and felt more than a little alone in a crowd.\n\nThe music of the river\nwas soothing, and Ivoreth put the full buckets down carefully on the\nriverbank and then splashed cool water up into her face to wash away\nthe dust from the day's travel. She rose and took up the buckets\nagain and carried them back to the fire circle and Belegorn. Her\ngaze roamed the camp to find her Ada still grooming Morrod, although\nCelebriel had joined him and now the two of them were caught up in an\nanimated conversation that included some laughter. Now that Ada was\naround all the time, she was beginning to notice that Celebriel's\nsmile came just a little quicker for him than for anyone else \u2013 and\nthat Ada himself seemed of lighter heart when she was near. The\nfondness between the two made her inclusion in their group that much\nmore secure.\n\nIt was one of Ivoreth's\ngreatest regrets, however, that not all in the family was put to\nrights as yet. Once more, Ivoreth's gaze obsessively sought out\nElrohir. So much of her new life was good and beautiful now that she\nwas free of Minas Tirith and all the memories that belonged there;\nand yet, his continued distance and disapproval of her ached\ndesperately. He was alone now, grooming his own mount \u2013 Raini was\nwandering over to where Ada and Celebriel were talking \u2013 and if she\nwanted to speak to him without being overheard, now would be the\ntime.\n\n Do I dare? What if\nhe refuses to talk to me again? How can he know how sorry I am if he\nnever speaks to me again?\n\nElrohir's war\nstallion was as black and huge as Morrod, and Ivoreth knew it took\nhim just as long to groom the beast as it took Ada to care for his\nown mount. And now that Raini had caught Ada's attention and would\nnot need his vigilance, Elrohir had turned his full concentration on\nbrushing the black war stallion until he shone.\n\nIvoreth took a deep\nbreath to gather her courage and walked toward her Ada's brother.\nShe stopped when she was close enough that she knew he was aware of\nher presence, and she watched him work for a long moment. \"Is\nthere anything I can do for you, Elrohir?\" she asked finally, when\nno other ideas for beginning a conversation would come to her.\n\n\"No, thank you,\"\nwas the brusque reply, with Elrohir not even glancing in her\ndirection.\n\nThe rebuff wasn't\nunexpected, but it still stung. \"Can I ask you\u2026\"\n\n\"I'm busy,\nIvoreth,\" he interrupted her. \"I'm certain Belegorn could use\nyour help getting the meal around; I suggest you speak to him and let\nme finish my work.\"\n\nNormally, this kind of\nresponse was enough to push her into walking away while struggling to\ncontrol her sadness. This time, desperation demanded she try one\nmore time. \"Are you going to be mad at me forever?\"\n\nThe motion of running\nthe brush over the stallion's flanks hesitated slightly before\ncontinuing. \"I don't know,\" he replied coldly. \"I haven't\ndecided yet.\"\n\n\"I don't want you\nto be mad at me anymore.\" It came out only barely louder than a\nwhisper.\n\n\"What you want\nmatters little at this point.\" Finally Elrohir turned to her, and\nIvoreth bore with the cold and angry expression out of gratitude that\nit was more than a simple dismissal. \"You betrayed my trust \u2013\nthat isn't something that can be just set aside because it's\ninconvenient, Ivoreth. Trust is all any of us has in the other, and\nit is a fragile thing that can easily be shattered by simplest words\nor deeds. Once gone, it is difficult at best to build again, if not\noften impossible.\"\n\nThe tears she'd been\nworking so hard to control escaped. \"I'm so sorry. I will never\ndo anything like that again, Elrohir, I swear it. Please\u2026\"\n\nHe shook his head at\nher, and it was as if Ada himself denied her yet again. \"Crying\nabout it isn't going to aid your cause either. This is the\nconsequence of your actions, and you'll have to learn to live with\nit. My trust was given to you freely once, and you broke it without\na single thought. I'm not going to just give it to you again;\nyou'll have to earn it this time.\"\n\n\"What must I do,\nthen?\" she begged, stepping closer to the Elf who was so much like\nher Ada she sometimes wondered which one she was looking at \u2013 until\nlately, that is. Now she could distinguish them easily; Ada smiled\nat her and Elrohir ignored or scowled at her. The resemblance\nbetween the two still confused her emotionally, however, and the\nrebuffs from Elrohir echoed within as if Elladan himself was pushing\nher away. \"Tell me what to do!\"\n\n\"You will have to\nprove to me that you deserve to be forgiven, and the only way you can\ndo that is to be honest and truthful with others; and not just for\nthe next few days, but from now on until the end of your days. I\nwill have to know just from watching you that you no longer are\nthinking like a thief from Minas Tirith, but rather like a proper\ndaughter from the house of Elrond.\" His gaze lost some of its\nanger, and became wary, but did not stray from boring straight into\nher soul. \"Do you understand what I'm telling you?\"\n\n No. I don't\nunderstand you at all. I give up.\n\nIvoreth shook her head\nand turned away. Somehow she was going to have to learn to stay away\nfrom Elrohir completely from now on. He didn't want to make things\nright ever again, and she didn't want to feel as she did in that\nmoment. She turned her head and looked around and then bolted for\nthe nearest stand of trees at the fastest run she could manage. She\nhad to get away, and get away  now .\n\n\"Ivoreth! Come back\nhere!\" she heard him call out to her, his voice sharp and\nangry-sounding again. She ignored him \u2013 doing to him what he'd\nbeen doing to her and evidently would keep doing to her \u2013 and kept\nrunning. There were bushes at the base of the trees that were tall\nenough to hide her. For the first time since leaving the City,\nIvoreth found herself wishing for the convenient drainage channels\nthat had been her refuges and escape routes for so long.\n\nShe headed towards the\nbase of the thickest brambles she could find, fear giving her feet\nwings as she heard the sound of a larger person who could only be\nElrohir pushing through the bushes altogether too closely behind her.\n The thorns caught at the suede of her tunic and skirt, but she\ndidn't let them slow her anymore than possible. There was a hollow\nat the base of the largest tree around which the brambles had grown,\nand she pushed herself as deeply into the tree as she could.\n\n\"Come out here\nimmediately! It isn't safe in the trees after dark, and Anor will\nbe setting soon!\" Elrohir called out again, obviously trying to\npush through into the thicker brambles and being deterred, as Ivoreth\nhad hoped. \" Nuath ! Ivoreth!\"\n\nIvoreth ignored him and\ncurled herself up into a small ball and threw her arm over her head.\n\n I should never have\nsaid anything to him. Ada told me that I'd have to bear whatever\npunishment Elrohir chose to give me without complaint, but I didn't\nknow that I'd have to live with him being angry at me all the time\nfrom now on. I wish he'd just hit me and be done with it, like Da\nwould have.\n\nAfter a while, the\nsounds of an Elf calling for her and trying to force his way through\nthe thorns ceased, and Ivoreth relaxed a bit from her protective\ncurl, let her arm fall to her side and then leaned back against the\ninside of the tree. If she went back to Ada, Elrohir would see her\nand be even angrier at her for disobeying him. And, most likely, Ada\nwould be angry with her as well. But the past three nights had\neasily been as cold and uncomfortable as the cistern had ever been,\nand even tucked within the protection of a tree, Ivoreth knew that\nwithout a blanket, she'd suffer the cold even more. And she was\nhungry; she'd not eaten well since leaving the City, mostly because\nthe constant reminder of Elrohir's anger stole any desire to eat\naway very quickly. If she stayed here, she'd not only be very cold\nvery soon, but would remain hungry.\n\nShe had two choices,\nneither of which were good ones. She wrapped her arms around herself\ndefensively, aching not only from the long hours in the saddle and\nthe deep scratches on her face and arms, but from the bleeding wound\nin her soul from her guilt at what she'd done and Elrohir's\nrefusal to forgive her for it.\n\n Ada! I don't know\nwhat to do \u2013 tell me what to do!\n\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*\n\n\"Ivoreth. Daughter.\nCome out now. You cannot remain here all night.\"\n\nIvoreth roused and\nimmediately shivered. Night had fallen, and the deep dark was\nbitterly cold without a blanket or the warmth of the camp fire.\nWorse, the hollow she'd slipped into was small enough that her\nmuscles had stiffened painfully from being forced to fold themselves\nto fit.\n\n\"Ivoreth,\" came the\ncall again, this time in a patient and worried tone, \"come out and\ncome to the fire with me now. You need to eat and warm yourself, or\nyou'll make yourself ill.\"\n\n Ada. He doesn't\nsound angry. But\u2026 is he?\n\nStill, the idea that\nhe'd come for her and waited outside the protective shield of\nbrambles for her to come to him gave her a little courage to face\nhim. Very slowly she tried to unfold herself and groaned when her\nlegs refused to do as she wanted them to.\n\n\"Ada, I can't\nmove,\" she whimpered desperately. She now wanted nothing more than\nto be in her Ada's arms, where she could be warm. Ada knew how to\nmake her stop hurting.\n\n\"I'm coming.\"\nIvoreth could hear the sound of movement in front of her for a few\nmoments. \"You really managed to get yourself stuck, didn't you?\"\nhe commented as his large hands suddenly appeared and carefully\npulled her from beneath the tree and through the thorns with ease.\n\n If Ada could get to\nme, why didn't Elrohir try? Does he  really  hate me so much?\n\nThe moment she was\nfree, and before she had a chance to look around for the soft glow\nthat was her Ada, she found herself wrapped in a warm blanket and\ngathered into comforting arms. \"Are you mad at me too?\" she\nasked in a small voice, too tired not to lean her head on her Ada's\nshoulder in utter relief.\n\n\"We will talk once\nyou've eaten,\" was the answer.\n\nIvoreth's stomach\nchurned.  So he  is  angry, then. Can I do nothing right\nanymore?  \"I'm not hungry,\" she whimpered. The very\nthought of food made her half sick, despite the hollow and empty\nfeeling in her stomach. She shivered despite the blanket, chilled to\nthe bone.\n\nAda didn't reply,\njust tightened his arms about her as she could feel his lengthy\nstride carry her back to the camp. She turned her face into his neck\nand kept her eyes tightly closed so that if Elrohir were nearby, she\ncouldn't see him at all. Ada brought her close to the fire, and\nIvoreth sighed as the warmth finally began to slow her shivers. He\nsat down and stationed her on his lap so that she faced the fire, and\nthen reached up when Pilimor handed him a thin wooden trencher with\nwhat promised to be a succulent roast fish and some of the remaining\nbread.\n\nAda set the trencher in\nIvoreth's lap, but she shook her head and moved it to the ground\nnext to her. \"I'm not hungry, Ada,\" she repeated. The smell\nof the food turned her stomach. Tired beyond all belief, she closed\nher eyes and leaned back against Ada, praying that she could avoid\nthe scolding that was certain to come by falling asleep before it got\nstarted.\n\n\"Didn't Elrohir\ntell you that it was dangerous to be where you were after dark?\"\nAda asked in his calm voice \u2013 the one that made Ivoreth cringe when\nhe was reminding her of something she should have known or listened\nto. Still, she loved Ada enough to give him an honest answer, so she\nnodded. \"Then why\u2026\"\n\n\"Because he hates me,\nand I just wanted to get away,\" slipped out before she had a chance\nto think.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nIvoreth sighed again\nand turned to try to tuck her face into her Ada's shoulder.\n\n\"No, Ivoreth. What\nmakes you think he hates you?\" Ada sounded confused and concerned.\n\n\"I asked him if he\nwas going to be mad at me forever, and he said he didn't know,\"\nIvoreth gave up with a shudder and pulled herself into a smaller ball\non Ada's lap. \"He told me there was nothing I could do to make\nhim like me again \u2013 and asked if I understood.\" A small sob\nescaped. \"I didn't understand, and all I wanted to do was get\naway from him.\"\n\n\"There are still\nwolves and other beasts who would find a girl like you a juicy meal,\nsweetling,\" Ada told her, pulling her to him again and then rubbing\nsmall circles onto her back through the blanket. \"He may still be\nangry with you, but he wouldn't want any harm to come to you. You\nshould have come back with him when he called.\"\n\n\"He doesn't care\nwhat happens to me, and it just hurts so much to see him\u2026\"\nIvoreth buried her face in the soft suede of Ada's tunic. She\ndidn't have the words to tell him of her pain or how Elrohir's\nbehavior wounded her.\n\n\"He cares, Ivoreth.\nIf he didn't, he wouldn't still be angry.\"\n\n It doesn't matter\nanymore. The only thing that is important anymore is to make sure\nthat Ada doesn't stop loving me the way Elrohir has.\n\n\"I'm sorry I ran,\nAda. I promise I won't do it again. I'll stay close to you and\ndo exactly what you tell me.\" Since that seemed to be the thing\nthat Ada was most concerned about, it was an easy promise to make.\nShe  wouldn't  run away from the camp again. She'd also\nnever go anywhere near Elrohir again either - not if she could help\nit \u2013 and she'd certainly never try to talk to him at all anymore.\n\nAda seemed to hear her\ninner thoughts the way he sometimes did when she was very upset.\n\"You need to be patient with Elrohir, little one. He has always\nbeen quick to anger and very slow to forgive, even when we were\nelflings. I know that you want to make things right, but the only\nway he'll accept is for you to leave him alone until he's ready\nto forgive, and then it will be an easy thing.\" He inserted a\nfinger beneath her chin and lifted her face to his, and her eyes\nopened and gazed sadly at him in the golden glow of the flames.\n\"Trust me, Ivoreth; I've been through this with him too, many\ntimes.\"\n\nSomehow, knowing that\nAda knew the pain of his brother's rejection helped a bit. Ivoreth\nbit her lip, nodded again and tucked her face back into his tunic.\n\n\"Now, won't you eat\n\u2013 just a little?\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\"I'm not hungry, Ada \u2013 really.\" Her stomach growled, but she\nwas sure that if she tried to eat, it would only come right back up\nagain.\n\nCelebriel moved to sit\ndown beside Ada and smoothed her hand over Ivoreth's head. \"Can\nyou get me the salve from my bundle?\" Ada asked her in a soft\nvoice. \"I need to treat the scratches on her body before they get\ninfected.\"\n\n\"Did she tell you\nanything?\" the elleth asked when she returned, and Ivoreth could\nhear the worry in her voice.\n\n\"It is as you\nsuspected,\" Ada replied, and Ivoreth felt the first gentle\napplication of an oily substance being rubbed into the worst of the\ngouges the thorns had left on her right arm. It stung, and she\nhissed a complaint but didn't shrink away from Ada's touch.\nAfter the first few times, she knew what to expect and didn't even\nhiss anymore.\n\n He wouldn't use\nthat stuff if it wasn't going to help.\n\n\"I'm glad we'll\nbe in LothL\u00f3rien in the next day or so. Maybe the Lady can help\nher,\" Celebriel commented, holding out her arms. \"Here, give\nher to me; you can treat her better if I hold her.\"\n\n\"I'm not certain\nthat it's Ivoreth who needs the help at the moment,\" Ada replied,\ngently shifting Ivoreth into Celebriel's lap so that he could\ncontinue to treat the scratches.\n\n\"Go to sleep,\n nethben ,\" Celebriel soothed, running a hand over Ivoreth's\ntangled hair. \"Things will be better in the morning, I promise.\"\n\n Better for whom?\n\nBut Ivoreth had no more\nenergy left with which to remain awake, and her eyes slid closed.\n\n Sindarin Vocabulary:\n\n Hiril n\u00een - my Lady\n\n Nethben - Little One\n\n Nuath - Shadow, a\nmild expletive"}

Do not move!\"  Faramir freezes, suddenly and acutely aware that he is not where he should be. The taste of dank and rot fills his mouth. Darkness shrouds his vision. Damp, sucking mud clings to his arms. Shivering violently, he finds himself lying flat on his back in what feels like a stagnant pond. \"Where\u2014\"  \"Hush! If you voice your fear, they will kill you!\"  Faramir blinks, and the darkness retreats enough for him to see another kneeling at his side. \"Legolas? Legolas, what\u2014\"  \"There is time.\" A hand rests upon Faramir's chest as though to prevent him from moving, but Legolas's attention is not on Faramir. It is on the shadows around them. \"You can still confront your fear, but you must do so in silence.\"  Utterly bewildered, Faramir pushes himself upright, dislodging the elf's hand. Confusion and a growing sense of alarm make it difficult to ask even one of his myriad questions, but eventually Faramir manages, \"Where are we? How\u2014\"  \"They come!\" Legolas's hissing rasp is harsh and strained. He snaps his gaze to Faramir, facing him for the first time, and the chill of the water lapping Faramir's legs is nothing compared to the chill in the elf's eyes. \"They must not see you with me. You must face them alone!\"  \"Legolas!\"  Legolas darts away, disappearing from sight. Faramir scrambles to his feet and tries to follow, but the shadows close too quickly. Night blinds him to all save darkness.  \"Legolas cannot help you.\"  Faramir spins about, one hand flying to an empty scabbard hanging from his belt.  \"Nor can any who enter this place,\" the new voice adds, and as it did with Legolas, the murk lifts just enough to reveal the speaker.  \"Gimli!\" Faramir exclaims, staring at the dwarf. \"Gimli, I\u2026 Think not that I am unhappy to see you, but how are you here? How am  I  here? Where\u2014\"  \"I have no answers to your questions,\" Gimli interrupts. \"Not yet. Soon. When I do, perhaps he will return. Perhaps you will find help. But you must not voice your fear! If you do, then there is no hope. Do  not  voice your fear!\"  Faramir stares, frustration warring with caution. \"I do not understand what\u2014\"  \"Of course not!\" Gimli says sharply, and something in his voice makes Faramir pause. \"How could you understand? You have denied that which would enable understanding. And to that end I ask: Who are you?\"  Faramir takes a shaky breath. \"My friend, do you not know me? I am Faramir.\"  For a long moment, the dwarf studies Faramir. Then his eyes dull, and his head bows. \"No,\" Gimli whispers. \"Not yet.\"  Faramir shoots upright, heavy blankets pooling in his lap. His heart pounds in his chest, and sweat trickles down the back of his neck. One shaking hand runs through his tousled hair while the other fists the thick folds of his sleeping pallet.  A dream.  Nothing more than a dream.  A dream identical to a dream from the night before\u2026  With a slow shudder, Faramir bows his head and rests his chin upon his chest. His limbs still tremble, but he no longer gasps for air. His body, at least, is calming; his thoughts are another matter. The images from the dream are as vivid now as they were when he slept, and those images trouble him.  Faramir frees his feet from the twisted blankets and feels about for his boots. It will be some time ere he can sleep again, and spending that time alone in a dark tent with dark thoughts does not appeal. He requires movement. Conversation. Something to leech the turmoil from his mind so he can better examine the dream. When this dream came the previous night, he noted it but gave it little heed. No stranger to night terrors, Faramir assumed his restless slumber resulted from proximity to the Nindalf. He has no pleasant memories of the bogs below the Falls of Rauros, and at the time, it seemed only natural for the Nindalf's foul smells to inspire foul dreams. But now that the dream has come again, Faramir cannot easily dismiss it.  But neither can he easily study it until he is calmer.  Finding his boots and wrestling them onto his feet, he stands and pulls a thick cloak about his shoulders. Spring near the marshes is always cold. Snowmelt cascades down both the Anduin and the Entwash, filling the swamp where they meet with frigid water. The chill of the water then lends itself to the chill of the air, especially at night, and Faramir already misses the warmth of his blankets. But he knows the cold will clear his mind, so he pushes through the flaps of his tent.  He immediately wrinkles his nose. During the long struggle against Sauron, he was occasionally forced to lead Rangers into the Nindalf, sometimes for concealment and sometimes in pursuit. No matter the reason, the experience always involved nauseating odors, and even on the edge of the swamps, these smells stir dark memories.  Rubbing his arms, Faramir reminds himself that their current situation might be equally dark. The number of people to mysteriously vanish around the Nindalf is a growing mystery that hints of ominous designs. The loss of one or two could be understandable; tragic accidents are not unheard of when spring floods the fens. But the disappearances are increasing as summer approaches, and the victims' companions say someone or something is moving within the swamp. Even more troubling is that many of the disappearances take place on the northern edge of An\u00f3rien, where the King's authority is direct and absolute. Such a blatant disregard for the crown is particularly worrisome.  His thoughts turning to Aragorn, Faramir glances across the fire pit at the King's tent. To his surprise, he finds it lit from within, the glow of candlelight spilling out beneath the sides. Aragorn is still awake.  Hesitation wars against hope. Speaking with Aragorn will soothe Faramir's mind; there is no doubt of that. But Aragorn will almost certainly sense Faramir's unease and inquire after it. Given the dream's twin warnings about voicing fear, Faramir would like more time to examine the dream before seeking another's counsel. Moreover, there is a\u2026  weight  to the dream. A feeling of portent. Of foresight. It is not unlike what he experienced when he dreamed of the command to seek out Imladris, Isildur's Bane, and the Halfling. And after losing Boromir to those promptings, Faramir is in no hurry to repeat history.  But the glow of the tent is inviting, and the promise of both a stalwart liege and a wise friend overcomes reluctance. Wrapping his cloak tightly about himself, he sets out toward the King.  The guards about Aragorn's tent straighten at his approach, but when they recognize him, they nod a greeting and stand aside. One steps back toward the tent and speaks quiet words before moving away and gesturing for Faramir to enter. Now standing before the tent flaps, Faramir inclines his head in silent thanks, clears his throat to announce his presence, and steps inside.  \"Lord Steward,\" Aragorn greets, his gray eyes sweeping over Faramir.  \"My liege,\" Faramir answers, sketching a brief bow before stepping further into the tent. The King is seated at a small plank table covered with maps. And\u00faril lies before him, and he is polishing the blade with quick, sure strokes. The presence of the sword on the table seems to be all that has changed since Aragorn met with Faramir and Legolas to discuss the best strategy for searching the Nindalf. That was hours ago, but Aragorn undoubtedly poured over the maps long after Faramir and Legolas departed.  \"I thought you had taken yourself to bed,\" Aragorn says, interrupting Faramir's musings.  \"I thought you had done the same,\" Faramir replies, hoping the deflection will be enough to stall questions.  \"Soon, yes, but you professed a need for sleep. Surely that need is not already satisfied.\"  Aragorn's gaze sharpens, and his hands still on his sword. Faramir quickly casts about for a distraction. His eyes settle on the maps, and he moves to the table to better examine them. There is nothing subtle about his ploy, but perhaps so obvious an evasion will dissuade Aragorn by virtue of sheer surprise. \"Has Legolas returned?\" Faramir asks, picking up one of the maps.  There is a pause before Aragorn answers. \"Not yet. He sent word that he was venturing into the swamps with the scouts. I do not expect him to return until morning. If the elves find a path of firm ground, they will follow it to see how far we may trust the trail.\"  \"I will marvel greatly if any trail they find offers aught in the way of firm ground,\" Faramir murmurs, tapping his fingers on the parchments. The foremost map depicts the Argonath, Nin Hithoel, the Falls of Rauros, and the swampy Nindalf below the falls where the Entwash flows out of Rohan to join the Anduin. The courses of the two rivers and all around them are clearly marked, but the ever-changing swamp has few details.  \"When did you last enter the fens?\"  Still hunched over the maps, Faramir risks a glance at Aragorn. Though the King is again polishing And\u00faril, something in his demeanor suggests his mind is not on the sword. But neither is he pressing the issue of Faramir's sleeplessness, and Faramir cannot decide if he should be concerned or relieved. \"Four years ago, my liege.\"  On the other side of the rough table, Aragorn sets aside his polishing cloth and holds And\u00faril up to the candlelight, sighting down the blade. \"That would be two years before Sauron's fall,\" he murmurs. \"Curious. I also found myself in the Nindalf that year.\"  \"Indeed? Which season?\"  \"The end of summer.\" Aragorn grimaces. \"I was tracking the creature Gollum, and his trail forced me into the fens. Fortunately, he only subjected me to the Nindalf. He was on the border of the Dead Marshes months later when I caught him, and grateful am I that he did not venture further. I would sooner wade the Nindalf ten times over than contend with the lights of the departed.\"  \"We missed one another by only a few weeks, then, for my Rangers followed a group of orcs into the Nindalf during the harvest,\" Faramir says, his brow furrowing at the memories. \"The fens are driest just before winter, but even so, we went forth on foot. It was too dangerous for horses.\"  \"We shall have to do likewise now,\" Aragorn sighs, setting And\u00faril down. \"This past winter was wet.\"  \"Which makes our mystery all the more confounding.\" Faramir traces one hand over the maps. \"Travelers have been vanishing around the Nindalf as though it is home to brigands, but I cannot fathom even the most desperate thief making these swamps his base.\"  \"Agreed,\" Aragorn says. \"And I remember well your words at supper: A band large enough to be responsible for all these disappearances would find no place large enough to shelter in the Nindalf. Since then, I have called to mind my own experiences in the marshes, but I have had no more success than you. There are countless clusters of trees and brush throughout the bog, but there is little in the way of firm ground where one might construct a camp. Not in the spring, at least, when the waters are highest. Yet the reports seem clear: The attacks come from the Nindalf.\"  \"With respect, I must disagree,\" Faramir says as wind stirs the sides of the tent. \"The reports are  not  clear. They are taken from distraught and grieving kin.\"  \"Yet you agree we should focus our searches around the Nindalf.\"  \"It is the only common thread among the stories,\" Faramir says, raising his voice as the wind blows open the tent flaps. \"Merchants traveling north from Cair Andros,\" he continues. \"Homesteaders along the Entwash. Traders upon the Anduin between Osgiliath and the Falls of Rauros. They all speak of the Nindalf, but\u2026\" He trails off, a strange foreboding chilling his heart.  \"But\u2026?\" Aragorn prompts.  Faramir shakes his head, his eyes drawn to a flickering candle.  \"Faramir?\"  The tiny flame dances, swaying in time to the distant sound of\u2014  \"Faramir\u2026!\"  -0-0-0-0-  \"Lie still. Do not move!\"  Faramir freezes, suddenly and acutely aware that he is not where he should be, but also suddenly and acutely aware of where he is. It is the dream! The dream that is making its third appearance! Yet only moments ago, he was in Aragorn's tent! Wresting his arms free of clinging mud, he pushes upright and immediately feels Legolas's restraining hand upon his chest. \"What\u2014\"  \"Hush! If you voice your fear, they will kill you!\"  The elf has spoken these words twice already, but they still make no sense. When the shadows lift, Faramir catches a glimpse of strained features as Legolas stares into the darkness. \"Legolas, I do not understand! How\u2014\"  \"There is time. You can still confront your fear, but you must do so in silence.\"  \"What fear?\" Faramir demands. \"What do you\u2014\"  \"They come!\" Legolas hisses. His glance snaps toward Faramir, and his eyes glint with something fell. Something crazed. Something that stirs Faramir's last memories of Denethor. \"They must not see you with me. You must face them alone!\"  \"Legolas!\" But as before, the elf is gone, enveloped by the dark. Faramir is powerless to alter the course of his nightmare. Or is it still a nightmare? Is it real? He cannot remember going to sleep, but neither can he remember anything that would explain his presence in what seems to be the middle of the wretched Nindalf! Struggling to his feet, he wraps his arms about himself, wondering if\u2014  \"Legolas cannot help you.\"  \"Gimli,\" Faramir whispers with relief. If Gimli is here, it is yet a dream, for in the waking world, Gimli is far away in Aglarond.  \"Nor can any who enter this place,\" Gimli continues as the shadows lift.  \"Why am I here?\" Faramir asks, hoping a challenge will prompt clarity. \"And what is your purpose? What do you and Legolas\u2014\"  \"I have no answers to your questions,\" Gimli says. \"Not yet. When I do, perhaps he will return. Perhaps you will find help. But you must not voice your fear! If you do, there is no hope. Do  not  voice your fear!\"  The dream is the same. The same yet not the same, for Faramir now knows it is a dream. But he is no closer to understanding. \"Will you not speak plainly? If there is a warning in this, I do not see\u2014\"  \"Of course you do not!\" Gimli snaps, and even if only slightly, the script of the dream changes. \"You see no warning, for you refuse to believe! You still deny! And thus I ask: Who are you?\"  Wondering why the dream is changing, Faramir hesitates. \"You asked me that before. I do not know what you\u2014\"  \"Who are you?\" Gimli roars, his eyes flashing.  \"Faramir,\" Faramir says firmly, hoping the dream's changes will continue. Hoping the changes will become answers. \"I am Faramir.\"  But as before, the dwarf's eyes dull and his head bows. \"No,\" he murmurs. \"Not yet.\"   \"Faramir!\"  \"Gimli!\" Faramir cries, reaching out. His fingers close around rich folds of fabric, but he does not grasp the dwarf's tunic. He grasps\u2014  \"Faramir!\" Aragorn's face is stern, and his voice is sharp. \"Faramir, look at me! Silence your thoughts and look at me!\"  Faramir shudders, and his hand falls away from Aragorn's sleeve. The King kneels beside him in terrible mimicry of the way Legolas kneels beside him in the nightmare. A shiver wracks Faramir. Suddenly, all he wishes to do is sleep. Dreamlessly. But the King has commanded, and summoning his faltering will, Faramir fixes his eyes upon Aragorn's.  \"Better,\" Aragorn says, his voice softening. \"Now, lie still and slow your breaths.\"  Faramir sees the roof of the tent behind Aragorn's head, and he wonders how he came to be lying down. On the King's pallet, no less. Loud voices call to one another outside, as though a commotion stirs in the camp. Turning his head toward the tent flaps, he begins to push himself up, but Aragorn immediately stops him.  \"Did you not hear me? Lie still!\"  Aragorn looks as though he wishes to say more, but the tent flaps part and two guards rush in. One bears a large brick of stone held gingerly with heavy tongs. The other carries a pot of boiling water. Under Aragorn's direction, the brick is placed beneath the blankets wrapping Faramir's feet, and Faramir immediately feels warmth soak into him from the fire-heated brick. The pot is placed beside Aragorn, and Faramir catches the sweet scent of  athelas  as the guards are dismissed with a quiet word.  \"I have been here all along,\" Faramir whispers, blinking at the realization.  \"In body,\" Aragorn says, \"but not in mind.\"  A headache begins to pound behind his eyes. \"What happened?\"  Aragorn raises his brow. \"That was to be my question for you. What do you remember?\"  \"Studying the maps of the Nindalf,\" Faramir says slowly.  \"Nothing else?\"  Faramir frowns. \"Wind. Fire. Then\u2014\"   Do not voice your fear .  Gimli's voice echoes through his mind. If the dream is a product of foresight, he can ill afford to ignore such a warning.  \"Then you collapsed.\"  Faramir flinches, his eyes snapping to Aragorn. \"Collapsed?\"  \"You fell onto the table and slid off one corner.\" Aragorn nods at the scattered maps on the floor, \"I caught you ere your head hit the ground, but I could not call you back to the waking world. Your mind was drawn too far away. Thus I return you to your own question: What happened?\"  Faramir takes a deep breath and pushes himself up. This time, Aragorn does not stop him, and Faramir is grateful. Lying down feels too vulnerable. \"Last night,\" he begins, \"I was visited by a strange dream. Earlier this evening, it came again.\"   Do not voice your fear .  \"When I collapsed here, I found myself once again caught in the dream,\" Faramir continues, wondering exactly what fear he is not supposed to voice.  \"What is the nature of this dream?\"  Faramir hesitates. \"I believe it to be a warning.\"  \"Of what?\"  \"I do not know. And if I did know, I do not know if I could tell you. In the dream\u2026\" He closes his eyes, searching for words. \"In the beginning of the dream, I am with Legolas. He says many things I do not understand, but his primary concern seems to be a warning: I must not voice my fear. Then Legolas leaves, and Gimli appears. He also speaks to me, and in the course of our conversation, he gives the same warning.\"  \"And because you must not voice this fear, you hesitate to say more,\" Aragorn guesses quietly.  Faramir nods, his eyes still closed.  \"Do you know of what fear they speak?\"  \"No,\" Faramir murmurs.  An aggrieved sigh breaks the stillness. \"I do not recall giving you leave to have difficult foresight on this venture.\"  Despite himself, a smile creeps over Faramir's face. Opening his eyes, he gives Aragorn a look that is equal parts amusement and protest. \"Were it not impertinent to do so, I might name another in this tent with a history of difficult foresight.\"  Aragorn returns the smile before sobering again. \"So you do not know what fear the dream warns against, and even if you did know, you could not voice it. What  can  you voice? Where does this dream occur?\"  Faramir's jaw clenches. He is reasonably certain the dream takes place in the Nindalf. What little he saw of his surroundings supports this, and the dream began only after arriving at the Nindalf. But while he does not  fear  the Nindalf, he cannot deny that the swamp inspires unease. \"I know where I am,\" he says carefully, \"and it is not a place I welcome.\"  Aragorn nods, seeming to understand when Faramir says no more. \"Do Legolas and Gimli caution you separately or together?\"  \"Separately. Only when one leaves does the other appear.\"  \"And both warn you against voicing your fear.\" Aragorn sits back on his heels, his gaze distant. \"Is there aught that  they  fear?\"  Faramir frowns, not having considered that. He plays the dream over in his mind and watches the details. He studies the strain on elven features. The curt words and harried movements. The way Legolas constantly searches the dark, only once glancing his way. \"Legolas fears something,\" he says at length. \"When he leaves the dream, I believe it is either to flee from it or charge toward it. But as for what this fear is, I do not know. Gimli\u2026\" He trails off, and something tells him this question is important. Whether or not Gimli fears something is important.  \"Gimli\u2026?\" Aragorn prompts.  Faramir's eyes narrow. Unlike Legolas, Gimli does not search the dark. He searches Faramir. His eyes are urgent. Measuring. Concerned. But fearful\u2026? \"There is no fear in Gimli,\" Faramir decides. \"Rather, there is warning and\u2026expectation. And when that expectation is not met, there is disappointment. But not fear.\" He pauses to search his memory again. \"Not yet,\" he amends, certain of his impression but uncertain of its meaning.  Aragorn's expression becomes almost a mirror for Gimli's. \" Will  there be fear?\"  His headache growing, Faramir closes his eyes. \"I do not know,\" he murmurs.  \"Why is Gimli present in this dream?\"  Another important question. Another question to which Faramir has no answer. He shakes his head in wordless frustration.  \"Are both Gimli and Legolas intent on the same purpose?\"  At least this question he can answer. \"No. As I said before, Legolas is concerned about whether or not I will voice my fear. Gimli\u2026\" Once more, Faramir finds himself at a loss. \"Like Legolas, he warns against voicing my fear, but that is not why he is in the dream. He asks a question of me, and it should be a simple question. But the answer I give does not satisfy, and the dream ends.\" Faramir grits his teeth. \"I do not know what he wants from me.\"  There is silence for a moment. Then a warm weight falls upon Faramir's shoulders. His eyes open in surprise, but before he can protest, Aragorn pushes him down onto the bedding with firm hands. \"We will speak of this later,\" Aragorn says, releasing Faramir with a warning look against rising. \"We are both weary, and reason will come easier when day drives back the night.\" He reaches into the pot at his side and pulls forth a damp cloth laden with the scent of  athelas . \"Sleep,\" he instructs, smoothing the fabric over Faramir's brow.  \"If I dream again\u2014\"  \"Then we will speak again,\" Aragorn interrupts. \"But for now, sleep.\"  Faramir relaxes back into the blankets, his body demanding he follow the King's orders. He watches Aragorn retrieve a stool from the table and set it next to the pallet. Askance, Faramir starts to sit up. \"My liege, you\u2014\"  \"I have slept in chairs far less comfortable than this, and given your earlier collapse, I would rather keep you where I can see you. Sleep!\"  The last word is a firm command, and Faramir is too tired to argue. With the warm cloth soothing his aching head, his thoughts begin to wander. Almost ere he is aware of it, his eyes close.

He\nlooked back to see the youngest of the rangers riding pell-mell\ntoward him, waving a hand over his head, and shouting. Aragorn's\nhorse sidled uneasily when the boy pulled to a sliding stop next to\nhis commander. Motioning the seven men behind him to wait out of\nearshot, the Chieftain of the Dunedain asked tersely, \"What is\nit? What has happened?\"  The boy shook his head\nreassuringly and panted, \"Nothing to threaten us, lord, but we\nhave guests \u2013 \" He drew a gasping breath and continued, \"Two\nof them, but one needs a healer; one of great power for Kenuric says\nhe cannot do more for him than cleanse him and put him to bed,\nalthough that will do for now.\"  Aragorn looked puzzled.\n\"He \u2013 whoever he is \u2013 is not on his deathbed? Then why ride\nyour horse nearly into the ground? I would have returned in a few\nhours at most.\"  The youngster\napologetically stroked his horse's neck but kept his eyes on his\nleader. His expression became somber as he said more quietly, \"He\nis on his deathbed, right enough, but Kenuric says it has been a long\ntime coming and he will not pass today, or for many days if you are\nable to tend him. But, Lord Aragorn, they are  elves !\"  \"What?! From\nImladris? Who -\"  The boy dared to reach\na calming hand to Aragorn's sleeve. \"No, not from Imladris! They\nhave not said yet where they are from, but we asked\u2014of course we\nasked\u2014if they came from Lord Elrond. They say they have been\ntraveling a long time and will wait to tell their story until you are\nreturned to camp.\"  \"I will come at\nonce, then, as soon as I send the patrol on.\"  Aragorn gave orders to\nthe curious men behind him, and then rode homeward with the young\nranger. At first glance they could have been brothers\u2014especially\nwhen clothed much alike in their ranger garb\u2014for both were broad\nshouldered but narrow through the hip, with dark hair and light eyes.\nNeither was hard to look at, but Aragorn's eyes were silver grey\nwhile his subordinate's were nearly as blue as periwinkles. Another\ndifference was the mantle of leadership that lay easily on Aragorn's\nshoulders. The youngster, spending his first years away from home,\nreminded one a bit of a puppy with his shy but ready smile, and his\neagerness to prove himself. As the two rode side-by-side, Aragorn\ninsisted they keep to a decorous pace while he listened carefully to\nwhat was known of the two strange elves.  \"I saw them come\nin, since I was training with Legolas\u2014he says he will make an\narcher of me or throttle me, one of the two! They rode in on two\nwell-bred horses that looked like they have been on the road for some\nweeks: they are footsore and thin. One of the elves is old, I think.\nI did not know elves ever looked old, but his face is drawn and he\nmoves slowly. He looks a little like Gandalf, as if he is very wise\nand patient. The other one is younger, I am sure, and allows his\ncompanion to speak for him. He dismounted quickly to help his elder\ndown before we could do him the courtesy. The older one nearly fell\ninto his arms, and then we could see he was badly wounded. We took\nhim at once to the healing hut and Kenuric is caring for him now. He\nwas able to speak and told us he was not from Imladris, Lorien, or\nMirkwood. He said he had news of orc movements to the east, but that\nthe telling could wait for your return. And that is all I know.\"  \"Well done, Arvel,\nyou have an observant eye. I must admit to a great deal of curiosity,\nso let us move on a little faster, now that your horse no longer\nlooks like he will expire at any moment!\"  The young ranger\ndropped his head in shame but raised it again when his hero set heels\nto his horse's sides and began to pull away. \"Wait for me!\"\n Aragorn's laugh drifted back to him as he pleaded with the tired\nhorse to catch up with his mocking commander.\nrangers in this territory was within an ancient wood, in an area that\nhad been used for charcoal burning before orcs and other dangers made\nit unprofitable. Only the largest trees remained, widely spaced, with\nno undergrowth beneath them except for closely grazed grass. In a\nwide clearing there could still be seen the large dusty circles where\nthe coppice wood had been burned to create charcoal. Just within the\nfringe of the surrounding trees were huge piles of wood trimmings;\nthey were leftovers from the charcoal process. Twice as tall as a\nman, they hid a cunning secret. They were the lodgings of the\nDunedain rangers: huts that could sleep nine or ten men at a pinch,\nwith small circular fire pits in the center, and trap doors that led\nto escape tunnels. One was given to Aragorn\u2014and Legolas and\nAragorn's brothers when they were in residence\u2014in consideration of\nhis status, one was devoted to the healing arts, and one provided\nlimited cooking when the weather made it difficult to cook outdoors.\nThe remaining four housed the rangers, providing snug quarters\nthrough the hard northern winters, though in milder weather the men\npreferred to sleep under the canopy of the trees.  The horses were\ncorralled far back in the trees, and as Aragorn walked the path that\nled to the clearing, the chief of the healers that served the rangers\ncame to meet him. Kenuric silently fell in beside Aragorn, and the\nyounger man shot sideways glances at him as they walked together to\nthe healing hut. Kenuric was tall and weedy, standing an inch or so\nabove his leader. He always moved with an impatient vigor, leaning\nforward as if into a strong headwind. Alone among all but the younger\nrangers, his face was unscarred, though deeply graven with lines from\nhis habitual scowl. The lines were all the easier to see since he was\nclean-shaven, though he made up the difference with long grey-blonde\nhair that he tied into a tail that hung down his back. His eyes were\na glittering pale blue, like evening shadows on snow, and some of the\nrangers said they were every bit as cold. Nonetheless, they trusted\ntheir lives to him without question, and many a man was still alive\nonly because of his stubborn will. He took the fight between himself\nand death personally, and when he lost a patient he did not weep, but\nswore bitterly and railed beneath the stars.  After walking together\nfor some time, Aragorn finally broke the silence. \"Are you going\nto tell me about them?\"  \"No. Best you meet\nthem and draw your own conclusions. You and I will speak privately\nafter you become acquainted.\"  Aragorn nodded, his\nstraight white teeth tugging on his lower lip. He watched Kenuric's\nface become flat and expressionless, and sighed. \"I have done it\nagain. What was it this time?\"  \" He  used to\nsink his teeth into his lip like that when he was thinking. I often\nscolded him for it, for he would create abrasions that I always\nfeared would become infected.\"  Aragorn smiled\nwistfully, \"Did they?\"  Kenuric snorted, \"No,\nblast him!\"  Aragorn laughed\noutright and touched Kenuric's arm briefly but in an unmistakable\ngesture of warmth. \"Then I am truly his son, for I never sicken\nnor do anything my family says is sure to happen to me, if I continue\nmy rash behavior. You should visit Imladris again; you and Lord\nElrond would have much to commiserate over!\"  Kemuric said quietly,\n\"When I was there for training, I did not speak with Lord Elrond\nof your father very much at all. Why should I, when we had so many\nlong years ahead of us? If I knew then how short our time together\nwould be\u2026\"  Aragorn sobered, and\nhis eyes turned to gaze across the compound to where an elf was\nremoving his weapons and laying them against one of the huts. The elf\nraised a hand as he returned Aragorn's regard. The man nodded to him,\nthen turned back to Kenuric. \"I have learned much from you but\nnothing of more importance than to value the time I have with my\nfriends.\"  Kenuric's reply stuck\nin his throat as he caught a brief glimmer of something odd in\nAragorn's eyes. It was gone as soon as he noticed it, but he filed\nthe occurrence away for later contemplation. He returned to the\nsubject of the two elves in the healers' hut. \"Come, you must be\nnearly consumed with curiosity as to the identity of our guests.\"  \"That I am!\"\nAragorn reached out to pull at a bit of fungus\u2014or what appeared to\nbe so\u2014and the door to the healing hut swung open. Inside, the walls\nwere smooth and whitewashed, with six narrow beds set up for patients\nand piles of bedding in the corners in case others must be\naccommodated on the floor. Aragorn stood a moment and let his eyes\nbecome accustomed to the indoor light. He first noticed a long, slim\nform occupying a bed close to the wall, and another being standing\nbehind it, pale hands tightly clasped and shining in the torchlight,\nwhile the face was in shadow.  Kenuric stepped forward\nto make the introductions. \"Lenw\u00eb, allow me to introduce to\nyou Aragorn, leader of the rangers, and a fine healer. Aragorn, this\nis our guest, Lenw\u00eb.\"  Aragorn stepped close\nto the bed and was barely able to control his expression. Propped up\non a pile of pillows stolen from the other beds, was an elf with hair\nof midnight black and dark gray eyes. His face bore not only a narrow\nscar that ran from his jaw to his eyebrow on the left side, but also\nlines of pain that were so deeply etched that he appeared old. His\ncomplexion was pale, even for an elf, and in addition had a sickly\nyellowish tinge. Aragorn now understood Arvel's words, for surely\nthis elf was well along the road to Mandos' halls. The elf smiled at\nAragorn slowly, as though to move his lips took great effort. He\ncarefully extended one finely shaped yet frail hand to Aragorn, who\nclasped it in both of his, feeling their healthy strength to be\nsuddenly coarse and excessively robust. \"Suilad, Aragorn. I\nthank you for the welcome and grace I have received. Your people are\nmost kind to aid us.\"  Aragorn looked up at\nthe figure standing so tensely and silently in the shadows beyond the\nhead of the bed. Lenw\u00eb gestured slightly. \"Come forward,\nNienor, and greet our host.\" He looked again to Aragorn. \"This\nis my friend who has cared for me most diligently during our travels.\nI pray one welcome holds for us both.\"  Aragorn looked at the\nelf as his face entered the light of the torches, and his breath was\ntaken away. Surely only two or three hundred years old, Nienor was\nextraordinary in his beauty, even by elven standards. His hair was a\nrich chestnut, glimmering in the torchlight with red and bronze\nhighlights. His eyes were the kind of hazel that takes its coloring\nfrom clothing or lighting, being at one moment a smoky green, and the\nnext the color of amber flecked with gold. His ears, uncovered by\nwarrior braids, were sharply tapered with slender tips. His\ncheekbones were high and his chin slightly pointed. His face was at\nthe moment blushing rose up to his temples and down his throat but\nwould normally be the color of the finest vellum\u2014pale cream warmed\nby days in the sun to a golden glow on brow and cheekbones.  Aragorn loosened his\njaw and nearly blushed himself to be caught staring, as he noticed a\nhint of amusement in the older elf's eyes. \"The Dunedain welcome\nyou both, for as long as you need to tarry here. Rest with us, regain\nyour strength, and let us do whatever we may to help you heal of your\nwounds or illness.\" To Aragorn's surprise, the young elf made a\ngraceful gesture with both hands but said no word. He stepped back\ninto the shadows and clasped his hands again, but Aragorn saw tension\nin every line of the slight body, and observed how the fine eyes\nflickered between the elf on the bed and the ranger almost\nsuspiciously.  \"Does your friend\nnot speak Common?\" The ranger turned to Nienor. \"Mae\ngovannen. Heniach nin?\"  The young elf's head\nmoved gracefully in negation and regret. Lenw\u00eb said gently, \"He\nis mute, Aragorn.\" At the man's startled look he added, \"But\nalthough he cannot speak, he hears better than most, so do not\nhesitate to give him direction as to how our few possessions should\nbe disposed and where he may sleep.\"  At those words the\nyoung elf moved abruptly and fell to his knees by the bed. He took\nthe elder's hand in one of his and made frantic gestures with the\nother, indicating the space between the bed and the wall. Lenw\u00eb\nspoke sternly, \"Hush, now! I will be fine here, and you will\nsleep wherever these kind folk bid you.\" He raised a shaking\nhand to touch Nienor's cheek. \"It will be well; you must not\nfret so for me.\"  Aragorn could not bear\nto watch the distress of the young elf and said quietly, \"We can\nmove one of the other beds close to you, Lenw\u00eb. There is no need\nfor him to be parted from you if he wishes to stay, especially since\nyou are our only patient at this time.\"  Nienor bowed deeply in\ngratitude and Lenw\u00eb gave another of his slow smiles. \"I\nmust thank you again, Aragorn, for such consideration of Nienor's\nfoolish fears. Now then, I am told you have a great gift, but while I\nwill be grateful for any ease you may give me, my trouble is an old\none and can wait to be tended. You have been on patrol and must wish\nto cleanse yourself of the dust of the road and get something to eat.\nI will still be here whenever it is convenient to tend to me.\"  Aragorn hesitated but\nthought that perhaps a little quiet and rest would be beneficial for\nthe elf, especially since he was still unaware of the nature of the\ninjury or illness, and did not yet know how taxing any treatment\nmight be. He bid both elves a temporary farewell and stepped out into\nthe leaf-patterned sunshine to speak with Kenuric. They moved a\nlittle away from the healers' cabin and with a raised eyebrow Aragorn\nindicated that the other man should begin.  Kenuric did not spare\nthe bitter truth. \"He is dying and no mistake. He took a\nhorrendous wound perhaps a decade ago and has been slowly wending his\nway to the Halls ever since. It was a scimitar of the Haradrim that\ncut him stem to stern\u2014I saw that type of wound often when I\ntraveled in the south. If he had not had the finest care at the time\nhe was injured, he would have died within a day or two at most. You\nwill be able to strengthen him for his journey but little more, so\nput out of your mind any great healing feats. Even Lord Elrond could\nnot save him. The wound becomes green again from time to time and\nthat is what has happened now. I have sent Legolas to fetch athelas\nand blue flag, so that they will have been freshly plucked today. Now\ngo and do as he suggests: clean yourself and get some food. It will\ntake me nearly an hour to prepare enough bandages and solutions, so\ntake some time and get a little rest. He will drain you, Aragorn, so\nbest be prepared.\"  \"That is a great\nsadness, but I trust your judgment. I will do as you bid me, if only\nto save myself the rough side of your tongue! One more thing, though.\nThe younger one, Nienor, have you examined him as well? It is unusual\nto see one who is mute but not deaf. May we not do more for him than\nfor his companion?\"  \"I had the same\nthought, but I have left him to you. He is very skittish and more\nthan a little suspicious of our intentions toward Lenw\u00eb. Let him\nsee you with his friend first, and then I think he will gentle to\nyour hand. You are, after all, known for your winning ways!\"  Aragorn rolled his eyes\nand turned away, smiling. The healer's words always had a little bite\nto them, but times had changed for the better between the two men.\nOnce Kenuric's words might have been similar, but the tone would have\nbeen sharp and bitter as a dagger's point. These days, Aragorn often\ndisgraced himself snorting back an inappropriate snicker when the\nhealer let his sarcasm loose in council meetings. The irascible old\nbadger was entertaining, Aragorn had to give him that. Though it was\nalways more amusing when the tongue he wielded like a weapon was\nturned on someone else!  Before he headed for\nthe hut that held the bread ovens, and the heavenly luxury of a hip\nbath out behind it in the trees, he went in search of Legolas. He was\nfortunate to find him quickly and filled him in on what he had\nlearned of their visitors. Legolas, nearly blending into the wall of\nthe hut behind him in his usual Mirkwood livery, creased his brow in\nthought as he sorted carefully through the green, leafy stems he had\ncollected. \"I have not heard of any elves wandering about on\ntheir own for many years, but in these times it is easy enough to be\nparted from your kin by violence or other mischance. The name Lenw\u00eb\nis familiar to me, but surely this cannot be  that  Lenw\u00eb.\nThey are not Noldor, you say?\"  \"The elder has the\nlook of it, but I believe he is of a kindred that diverged and took a\ndifferent life-path.\" Legolas' brows arched high in disbelief\nbut the man nodded, \"I think he is of the original Nandor. My\nfather spoke of them occasionally, saying there are a few still to be\nfound, passing like shadows over the earth. Nienor, now, is another\nstory. Are there any Silvan that have hair the color of buckeyes?\"\nLegolas shook his head in wonderment. \"Well, it is not important\nnow, I suppose. I would like you to be present while I examine them;\nit may put them more at ease, especially the younger of the two. It\nmay be that I will have to bring pain to Lenw\u00eb, and if Nienor\nmust be restrained, I would rather it be done by another elf. And\nLegolas\u2026\" Aragorn's eyes met his friend's with sadness.\n\"Nienor is mute\u2014he cannot speak. Will you do what you can to\nhelp him understand he is among friends?\"  Legolas looked a little\npuzzled. \"Of course, Aragorn. I will aid you and these elves in\nany way I can; surely you know you have no need to ask.\"  Aragorn gave his friend\na wry smile. \"I do know that. These two have unsettled me,\nthough it is hard to imagine anyone less a danger to us, or what we\ndo here. Pay me no mind; my foolishness will soon pass.\"  Legolas clapped him\nlightly on the shoulder. \"No doubt this  particular  foolishness\nwill pass, but I have great faith that you will find another!\""}

She was warm, dry, nestled down in a soft\nbed and covered with protective blankets. Around her, the room was\nsparsely yet comfortably furnished, and so very alien in both design\nand construction. Through an open window, graced on either side with\nwisps of thin and flowing material that could be pulled to provide\nprivacy without stealing the light, floated ethereal melodies and\neven more delicate harmonies sung by voices sweeter than any she'd\never heard.\n\nNowhere did she see the\nrough, bulky utilitarianism that was the mark of well-made D\u00fanedain\ncraftsmanship, no earthy,  human  smells that spoke of hard work\nand tenacity. There were no gruff voices grumbling in the distance,\nno sounds of wood being chopped for the hearth or iron being beaten\ninto usable forms.\n\nNo sign remained of the\nstorm that had broken over their heads the night before either. The\nsunlight through the windows was warm, and the sky visible through\nthe leaves of the trees a brilliant blue. It seemed as if all of the\nways in which her world had been overturned, disrupted, and darkened\nhad evaporated while she slept, leaving her in an unnerving calm and\nquiet.\n\nShe sat up in bed and\nmarveled at the simple yet delicate sleeping gown she wore; where had\nit come from and how had she come to wear it? Her long, dark braid\nover her right shoulder remained intriguingly intact after a night's\nsleep. Had she been so overwrought and beside herself when she had\narrived that she could remember  nothing  of what had happened\nthe night before? Could she remember  nothing  of who had\nhandled her, dressed her, braided her hair, tucked her into bed?\nThen her eyes widened and searched the room about her desperately.\n\nWhere was Aragorn?!\n\nA crib sat against the\nfar wall of the room \u2013 an  empty  crib \u2013 with crisp,\nspotless and smooth covers that had seen no weight put on them.\n\nGilraen surged out of\nbed and toward the door to the chamber, desperate and almost sobbing.\n She'd already lost Arathorn; all she had left was Aragorn, her\nson, her little heart. If he had been taken too, or if this strange\nplace had lured him away from her already\u2026\n\nThe door to her chamber\nopened without her having had a chance to lay a finger on the handle.\n Gilraen backed away in shock, and then stepped forward to jealously\nclaim a smiling and laughing Aragorn from the arms of one of the twin\nelves who had been her husband's friends and allies.\n\n\"Nana! Nana! E'dan\ntake me see baby horsies!\" the child squealed in glee, his little\nhands framing her face the way he did when he was excited and wanting\nher to know something.\n\n\"That was very nice\nof Elladan, wasn't it?\" she replied, pasting a shaky smile on her\nface. To have almost lost him, after everything else that had\nhappened\u2026 But he could never know how she feared for him; and she\ncould not fail to provide motherly direction, even as she prayed for\nher heart to stop trying to smash its way through her chest. \"Did\nyou tell him thank you?\"\n\nAragorn squirmed in her\narms to face the elf behind him now, all seriousness. \"T'ankoo,\nE'dan.\"\n\n\"It was my pleasure,\nlittle one.\" Gilraen would have gaped at the sound of laughter in\nthe normally grim elven voice but that she had looked up into grey\neyes that were dancing with a humor she'd never seen in them\nbefore, as well as a slight hint of chagrin. \"You have my\napologies. I did not mean to frighten you, Gilraen. We\u2026 Elrohir\nand I, that is\u2026 thought that you could use an uninterrupted night's\nsleep after everything, so we kept your son with us through the\nnight. I thought to bring him to his crib for a short nape before\nyou awoke.\"\n\nShe nodded her\nforgiveness, cradling her son closely as she looked into the elf's\nface. She was still very much in awe of the elven warriors who had\nbeen her husband's closest comrades in arms. Elladan, for all his\npoise, bore her gaze with apparent discomfort and shuffled his feet.\n\"But now that you are awake, perhaps you wouldn't mind if I took\ncharge of him again while you take your time preparing yourself for\nthe day.\" He smiled down at the little boy in her arms. \"I'm\nthinking Cook might have an extra apple or bowl of berries that could\ninterest a growing boy.\"\n\nAragorn squealed again\nand turned to his mother excitedly. \"Can I, Nana? P'ease?\"\n\nThe grey, elven eyes\ngazed evenly and deeply. \"He will be safe with me, Gilraen, I\npromise. I won't let him out of my sight.\"\n\n\"Well\u2026\"\n\n\"P'ease, Nana?\"\n\nGilraen couldn't\nresist the shining look in Aragorn's eyes \u2013 a look that she'd\nwondered would ever return during the long, hard days of fast travel\nto this strange, new place. \"Very well, but you must promise me to\ndo exactly as Elladan tells you.\"\n\n\"I p'omise, Nana.\"\n Aragorn gave his mother a sloppy kiss. \"I be good.\"\n\nGilraen tipped Aragorn\nback into the elf's waiting arms. \"Thank you, Elladan,\" she\nmurmured softly.\n\n\"It is my pleasure.\nIncidentally, my father has requested an opportunity to speak to you\nsometime today, but he wanted me to tell you that he would wish you\nto take the time to relax and get something to eat before then.\"\nElladan swung Aragorn up onto a shoulder. \"And when you're\nready, I'll show you the way to his study.\"\n\nGilraen stifled a\nshiver. It was bad enough to be around these warriors, but the\nthought of an interview with the legendary Elrond of Rivendell gave\nher pause. Still, it would be by his word that she would either be\ngiven refuge in this hidden elven stronghold or returned to her\npeople. Her eyes rested on her son. For him, she would make ready\nto see a figure out of a near-mythic past, to plead for sanctuary for\nher son, if for nothing else.\n\n\"I'll come find you\nwhen I'm ready,\" she told him softly. Elladan bowed, making\nAragorn giggle with the movement, and then ducked through the doorway\nagain.\n\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*\n\nTwo hairpins of mithril\n\u2013 a betrothal gift from her father less than four years earlier \u2013\nwas all it took to hold the still intact braid up and into place on\nthe back of Gilraen's head. Curled around itself and the tail end\ntucked safely behind the rest, the braid restrained by two pins\ncompleted Gilraen's transformation from wide-eyed and frightened\nyoung woman to a wide-eyed and wary D\u00fanadan matron. With a critical\neye, she studied her reflection in the polished metal that hung\nwithin the small bathing chamber.\n\nHer forehead was high,\nand her nose a little too narrow and upturned to allow her to be\nproclaimed a great beauty in the Angle. She pinched her cheeks,\nwanting to at least try to return a little life into a face that had\ngrown wan and pale with grief and fear for the future in the days\nsince Arathorn had been brought home to her wrapped in his cloak.\nThe cool water in the shallow basin in front of her helped diminish\nsome of the puffiness around her eyes, but the ease with which she\ncould fall to weeping again would soon undo all of her careful\npreparations \u2013 she just knew it.\n\nStill, she had to try.\nIt wouldn't do to face the judge of her doom looking anything less\nthan her best, such as it was. She found her best wanting now,\nhowever, especially in comparison with the delicate luxury that\nsurrounded her; as well as her memory of how even elven armor covered\nin thick gouts of black orc blood still managed to look rich and\nrefined.\n\nShe found her meager\nbundle of clothing carefully unpacked into a carven clothes press\nagainst the same wall as stood Aragorn's crib; and from it, she\nselected the nicest gown she owned: her wedding dress. Ignoring the\nmemories of a life snuffed out far too soon that sought to overwhelm\nher, she struggled with the laces and finally stuck her head out the\ndoor of the suite in humiliation to beg assistance from one of the\npassing elf women in the hallway. What would it say about her when\nit became known that she couldn't even successfully dress herself?\nNo matter; at least she was now properly garbed, washed and groomed.\nAll that remained was for her to survive the interview to come and\nhopefully vouchsafe the safety of her son. What happened to her\npersonally didn't matter in the end.\n\nShe had come to\nunderstand that message very clearly in the short hours of argument\nand then preparations for the flight to Imladris. Dirhael spared no\ndiplomacy in letting his daughter know that the one that needed the\nprotection was not her, but her little son; after all, on him hung so\nmany hopes. It hurt to be dismissed as unimportant, but she\nunderstood the reasoning nevertheless. It was a part of what she'd\naccepted when she agreed to marry the heir to the D\u00fanadan. She\nplayed her part willingly after the wedding \u2013 carried the heir to\nthe heir successfully and birthed him, and then brought the heir to\nthe D\u00fanadan up through most of his infancy and toddler-hood \u2013 but\nin light of the threat from the Enemy and now the death of her\nhusband, her efforts simply wouldn't be enough. Aragorn \u2013 heir\nof Isildur and Elendil, now Chieftain of the D\u00fanedain \u2013 needed to\ngo to Imladris immediately, where he could be protected until better\nable to defend himself. Gilraen had gone along mostly as a\nnursemaid, a convenient but very expendable nursemaid.\n\nGilraen swallowed hard\nand set aside those harsh memories. There was no more putting off\nwhat needed to happen. She exited the bathing chamber and walked to\nthe door of her suite. She opened the door and peered first down the\ncorridor to the left and then to the right, wondering which way led\nto the Lord Elrond's study.\n\n\"Lady Gilraen. Good\nmorning.\"\n\nShe turned to face one\nof the twins; and she assumed, seeing that Aragorn was nowhere in\nsight, that this must be Elrohir. As his brother had been before\nhim, the elf was dressed in rich robes, his dark blue where the\nother's had been emerald green. The long and silky ebony hair that\nso marked the two of them as different in a humble village setting\nfilled with tangled and curled locks the color of mud was carefully\nand delicately braided away from the youthful face. \"Lord\nElrohir?\" she inquired carefully. The tall elf bowed his head\ngracefully to acknowledge her correct assumption. \"Good morning.\nI understand your father wishes to see me. Could you help me\nplease?\"\n\n\"So he informed us\nlast night,\" the dark-haired warrior nodded again. \"But if\nyou're just now leaving your rooms, surely you'll want to break\nyour fast first.\"\n\nHer stomach tightened.\nRight now the last thing she wanted to do was eat, for fear that her\nnervousness would translate into nausea and further humiliation. \"If\nyou don't mind, I think I'd rather see Lord Elrond.\" She\nlooked back and forth again. \"Which way do I need to go?\"\n\n\"I'll be happy to\nshow you,\" Elrohir announced solemnly, offering his arm. \"Did\nyou rest well?\"\n\nGilraen flushed as she\ntucked her hand into the crook of his elbow. \"Too well, I think.\nI don't even remember getting into bed.\"\n\n\"I'm not surprised.\n You collapsed walking through the front door,\" the elf told her\ngently. \"My father made certain that you suffered from nothing\nmore than physical and emotional exhaustion, and then two of his\nassistant healers readied you for your rest while you still were\nunconscious.\" A warm hand covered hers and pinned it to his arm.\n\"I'm glad to see that you are much recovered this morning,\nalthough I'd feel much better if you'd at least break your fast\nwith something light and nourishing before you see my Adar. After\nall the stress of the journey and the sadness you've endured, you\ncould use something to sustain you.\"\n\n\"I'll be fine,\"\nGilraen reassured him quickly, not wanting to argue on her first day\nthere but not willing to concede to the solicitude offered her\neither, despite the fact that his thinking about her welfare brought\na warmth to her heart it hadn't enjoyed since she'd become an\nadult and a married woman. It was odd, seeing these stately elves as\nsomething other than fierce and grim warriors. For the very first\ntime, she began to appreciate why Arathorn felt such fondness for\nthese two that dated back to his own tenure here in this fantastic\nretreat, and to regret having ever held herself back and remote from\nthem when they came. Yes, they had ever summoned her husband off to\nfight the Enemy \u2013 and ultimately had called him away to a battle\nthat had meant his death \u2013 but she knew that even the least of the\nD\u00fanedain that rode and fought with them respected them and enjoyed\ntheir company between patrols.\n\n\"Very well, as you\nwish..\" Elrohir walked her down the stairs and then out a door and\ndown the length of an open walkway lined with statuary along the edge\nof a small but elegant garden.\n\nHer hand suddenly\ngrabbed the arm beneath it hard and pulled the both of them to a\nstop. \"Wait! Where's Aragorn?\"\n\nThe elf next to her\nchuckled, drawing her eyes to his face and finding his expression one\nof open delight. \"When last I saw them, only a short while ago,\nyour son and my brother were in the kitchen, driving the cooks to\ndistraction playing a game involving cherry pits and spoons as\ncatapults.\"\n\nThe absurdity of the\nidea that a stately elven warrior would lower himself to play such a\nsilly game with her son made Gilraen giggle, but it was a giggle that\nbordered on hysteria. \"I'm sorry,\" she stammered, her free\nhand to her lips as if that gesture would keep the tears from\noverflowing. \"You must think my mind unhinged.\"\n\n\"Nay, Lady. I have\nseen what grief does, and find your mind quite sound, under\nextraordinary circumstances.\" The grey eyes gazed into hers\nsteadily and with great compassion in their depths. \"Never forget\nthat Arathorn was my friend too, and Elrohir's. We understand the\ndifficulty you faced in coming here, to a new place so far from\nfamily and friends and kindred, and the way in which this move took\nplace almost before you knew what was happening.\" Elrohir's hand\non hers patted it gently. \"You're a very brave woman, Gilraen;\nnever doubt this.\" He gestured in the direction of the door in\nfront of which they had halted. \"This is my Adar's study.\"\n\nGilraen stared at the\ndoor dumbly for a long moment. \"I'm not so brave,\" she shook\nher head slowly, swallowing hard. \"I fear what lies behind that\ndoor.\"\n\n\"The unknown is\nalways the source of our greatest fears,\" Elrohir said, patting her\nhand again. \"However, as I know some of what awaits you, please\naccept my promise that it won't be half as bad as you think.\"\n\nShe gazed back into his\ngrey eyes for a long moment and found encouragement and comfort\nfreely offered, along with an unexpected echo of the grief that she\nkept carefully in check. \"Thank you,\" she whispered, slowly\nslipping her hand from his keeping. \"I shouldn't keep your\nfather waiting any longer than necessary.\"\n\n\"Then I bid you a\ngood day until I see you next.\" Elrohir bowed his head once again\nwith that fluid grace that defined all his movements and then\ncontinued down the covered walkway to turn toward the back end of the\nhouse. Gilraen watched him disappear around the corner and then\nturned to face the door. She took a deep breath and knocked.\n\n\"Come.\" The voice\nthat answered her knock was incredibly deep and full-timbred.\n\nQuailing, Gilraen\npushed the door open on silent hinges and found herself walking into\na large and elegantly appointed room lined on two walls, from floor\nto very tall ceiling, with fully laden bookcases. A sizeable hearth\n\u2013 surprisingly without any sign of hooks or pots for cooking - had\nthree comfortable-looking cushioned chairs stationed facing it. The\nfourth wall was open to yet another garden beyond, and in front of\nthat vast openness sat an immense desk.\n\nGilraen shivered as she\nwatched the Lord of Imladris himself rise and move from behind that\ndesk. Tall, robed in rich brown and tan brocades, and with ebony\nhair that cascaded to his waist braided delicately away from his\nyouthful face. Elrond Peredhel was easily as ageless as were his\nsons. \"Lady Gilraen, welcome to Imladris,\" he intoned, a\nlong-fingered and graceful hand reached out and captured hers in a\nwarm grasp. \"Please, come sit.\"\n\nGilraen finally dared\nglance up into Lord Elrond's eyes and immediately found herself\nlost within a grey gaze that held a full measure of the weight of\nimmeasurable time. There could be no mistaking who this raven-haired\nelf garbed in such fine materials must be. And if she'd ever felt\nout of her league before with Elladan or Elrohir earlier, she knew\nshe was doomed in her dealings with their father.\n\n\"Have you eaten yet\ntoday?\" Elrond asked, steering her so very gently into one of those\ncomfortable-looking chairs.\n\nGilraen shook her head\nwith a small motion. \"I was too nervous to eat,\" she admitted,\nwondering if being that honest would do her case any good at all.\n\n\"Allow me to remedy\nthat, then.\" Elrond moved to where he could gesture through the\nwide window behind his desk at someone in the garden. \"Please have\na light repast brought to my study,\" he asked and then turned with\na smile. \"It's entirely possible that your lack of appetite\nbeforehand contributed to your collapse last night, something I would\nrather not see repeated.\" As he returned to claim the chair next\nto hers, Gilraen wondered briefly if the elf walked, or glided.\n\nGilraen studied her\nhands, which she held clasped in her lap. She had to give Lord\nElrond credit, he was being as gracious and kind as she had heard him\nto be. Still, there was business to discuss. \"Lord Elrond\u2026\"\n\n\"I hope your\naccommodations are acceptable,\" he continued on as if she'd not\nsaid a word, folding his own hands in his lap to match her. \"If\nyou feel you and your son need more living space, however, you need\nonly\u2026\"\n\nShe gaped. The tiny\nsuite of rooms that had been allowed her was bigger than the home\nshe'd shared with Arathorn! \"Oh, no! My rooms are more than\nsufficient. Lord\u2026\"\n\n\"Good.\" Elrond\nbeamed. \"I hope you will let us know if there is anything else\nthat you need to make your stay a comfortable one.\"\n\n\"Yes \u2013 about my\nstay\u2026\"\n\nA knock brought the Elf\nLord out of his chair again to answer the door, leaving Gilraen with\nmouth slightly agape. When he turned back, he carried a tray with a\nplate holding slices of bread, slices of cheese, a short carafe of\nwine and another of water, and an empty goblet. \"This should help\ngive your system something to work with.\" He settled the tray on a\nsmall table next to her and took a seat in the next chair. \"Help\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Lord Elrond\u2026\"\n\n\"Eat, Gilraen,\"\nElrond told her with a gentle smile. \"There is plenty of time for\nthe discussions you and I need to have this day. But I would have\nthem with someone fully fortified for the day by having broken their\nfast properly. You need not rush this.\"\n\n\"But I would rather\nface it,\" Gilraen blurted, then pressed her fingers against her\nlips in embarrassment at the thought of contradicting such a fine\nlord. \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nThe elf settled back in\nhis chair and studied her calmly and carefully for a long moment.\n\"Perhaps, then, if your nerves won't allow you to nourish\nyourself yet, we should begin. I would see you break your fast\nsooner rather than later; but if the only way you'll agree to that\nis to get through some of what needs to be said between us first,\nthen so be it.\"\n\nShe slowly breathed out\na sigh of relief. He wasn't taking offense. \"Thank you,\" she\nwhispered.\n\n\"To the matter at\nhand, then. I have received the report from my sons about the\ncircumstances under which it was decided that you and your son come\nhere, and I have a letter from your father detailing the reasons such\na move was necessary from the perspective of your own people.\" The\ngrey eyes rested on her face without sign of emotion or any other\ninner working. \"And I must agree with the conclusions reached.\nYour son is no longer safe among his own people. The Enemy is\ndeliberately and systematically eliminating all possible heirs to the\nline of kings. If Aragorn is to survive, he must go into hiding.\"\n\nGilraen nodded, looking\ndown into her lap at her folded hands. \"I know,\" she said\nsoftly.\n\nShe looked up again\ninto Elrond's face when his hand reached across the distance to\ngrasp hers. \"I grieve with you on the loss of your husband, my\nLady. Arathorn was a good man, proud, capable, and yet kind. It was\nmy honor to know him and help him become the leader he was during his\ntenure here.\"\n\nThe tears, never very\nfar from the surface lately, spilled onto her cheeks without\nobstruction. She nodded again, dumbly.\n\n\"And I assure you, I\nhave no intention of turning away Arathorn's heir in his hour of\nneed. Your son is safe here, and my house will be glad to protect\nhim until such time as it's safe for him to return to your people.\"\n\nGilraen nodded again,\nher tears coming a little faster. She didn't have to plead for\nrefuge for Aragorn after all \u2013 Elrond was offering it freely!\n\"Thank you, my Lord.\" The knot in her stomach eased slightly.\n\nHe patted her hand and\nthen pulled back. \"Don't thank me yet; some of the steps that\nmust be taken to vouchsafe his safety will be difficult ones. Much\nwill need to be sacrificed to make certain that Aragorn grows to his\nfull maturity properly without drawing the attention of the Enemy to\nhim.\"\n\n\"Sacrifice?\" She\nstared at him, her heart plummeting. Once more she heard ringing in\nher mind her father's blunt assertion that it was Aragorn, not\nGilraen, who deserved and needed the refuge. Her son was no longer\nan infant, and she no longer was necessary for his physical\nsustenance, merely responsible at the moment for his emotional\nsupport and security. Would Elrond require that she leave him here\nand return to the Angle without him?\n\nCould she live with her\nheart utterly torn away?\n\n\"Yes, sacrifice. To\nprotect him properly, he'll have to stay here, in Imladris, until\nhe reaches his maturity. He cannot return to his people before\nthen.\"\n\nShe drew in a ragged\nbreath. \"I think my father already realizes this,\" she said with\na sigh.\n\n\"No doubt. Dirhael\nseems to be a canny leader in his own right.\" Elrond's tone was\nappreciative, and Gilraen soaked up every little bit of comfort from\nit that she could. \"But part of that separation will mean a\nnecessary break in the lines of contact between Imladris and the\nD\u00fanedain. The question of  why  the D\u00fanedain come so often to\nImladris cannot be asked, and therefore more visits than have been\nthe norm until now must be avoided at all costs, so that there are no\nreasons for such questions to arise.\"\n\n\"But\u2026\" She\nlooked into the perfect face. \"My son is the Chieftain. He needs\nto learn our ways, our culture, our\u2026\"\n\n\"My sons have spent\nmany generations with your people, Gilraen. As time goes by, they'll\nbe able to teach him much of what it means to be D\u00fanadan. As will\nyou, I'm certain. When the time comes\u2026\"\n\n\" Me ?\" She\nstared. \"I will be staying too, then?\"\n\nAt last she'd managed\nto surprise an elf. Elrond's eyes widened in shock, and he rose to\nhis feet quickly. \"Certainly you don't believe me capable of\nseparating a child barely out of swaddling from his mother,\nespecially just after having his father torn away from his life?\"\n\nGilraen closed her eyes\nand took a deep breath to steady herself. \"I know that it's my\nson's welfare that is of the most import, not my own. And if you\nbelieve it would be better that Aragorn remain here while I return\nto\u2026\"\n\n\"No. It's not\nbetter at all.\" Elrond's tone was emphatic, and he paced the\nfloor in front of the hearth almost angrily. \"Your son needs you\nnow, to give him a sense of security when all in his world has\nshifted so completely. You're the closest tie to his people that\nhe'll ever have until the day comes that he's ready to take up\nhis place as the leader of the D\u00fanedain himself.\" He shook his\nhead disbelieving. \"I would never force a mother to leave her\nyoung child behind, or demand such a young child go through his early\nyears without the love and support of his mother.\"\n\nAnother knot at the\nbottom of her stomach loosened. If nothing else, she would not lose\nher son as well as her husband. She reached out a shaking hand and\ntook a small slice of cheese from the tray next to her and nibbled,\ntrying hard not to keep crying. What would Lord Elrond think of a\nwoman who did nothing but sob in his presence?\n\n\"Gilraen.\" Gentle\nfingertips touched her knee, and she looked over at an Elf Lord who\nhad once more seated himself next to her, although only on the very\nedge of his chair. \"I spoke of sacrifice because the same\nrestriction on contact with your people must necessarily fall on you\nas well. I would that it could be otherwise, but until your son is\ngrown, you too must vanish to the D\u00fanedain. Any who come to\nImladris, for whatever reason, must never know that you're here\nlest that knowledge find those who would begin to ask the questions\nwe dare not allow arise.\"\n\nGilraen wiped at the\ntear tracks on her face with the back of her hand. \"That I can\nunderstand and accept. It will be hard; things here\u2026\" She\nlooked around her, at the very nature-based designs behind every\npiece of construction surrounding her that screamed of the\notherworldliness of the place she found herself in. \"\u2026are so\nvery strange from everything I grew up with.\" She took another\ndeep breath. \"But I knew, in marrying Arathorn, that much of my\nlife would involve doing my duty to my people. Just being allowed to\nstay with my son\u2026\" Again she choked and pressed her fingers to\nher lips to try to block the tears, and again she managed to control\nher emotions, but only barely. \"What you ask of me is no\nsacrifice, my Lord. I am grateful.\"\n\nElrond twisted to pour\na small amount of wine into the delicate goblet and then fill the\nvessel the rest of the way with water, and he handed her the drink.\n\"No wonder you were a bundle of nerves walking into my study this\nday. You feared losing your son so soon after losing your husband.\"\n He shook his head at the tiny nod she gave him as she accepted the\ngoblet and took a sip. \"I'm glad, then, to have a chance to set\nthose matters straight so quickly and easily.\" He smiled at her\nagain. \"I assure you, I am no monster. I would make your way here\nas simple and smooth as possible.\"\n\nShe gazed at him over\nthe top of her goblet. \"I appreciate that, Lord Elrond.\"\n\n\"Elrond, please.\nTitles have their places, but not in private, like we are now.\"\n\n\"Elrond,\" she\ncorrected herself and sipped at her wine again.\n\n\"And as we are\nspeaking of names and titles; that brings me to another of those\nsacrifices I was telling you about.\" He settled himself back more\ncomfortably into his chair again and steepled his fingers before his\nchest as he watched her. \"In order that your son disappear\ncompletely, I'm afraid we will have to disallow all mention of his\ntrue name and heritage in this house. We will allow rumors to spread\nthat when you arrived here, both you and your son were extremely ill,\nand I was unable to save his life. In that way, he will die to all\nbut a very few of your people who need to know the truth. And here\nin Imladris, he will become one of my household \u2013 albeit a mortal\none \u2013 and answer to a new name until he is ready for the\nresponsibilities and burden associated with his true name.\"\n\n\"What?\" Gilraen\nwas stunned. \"He is to be raised D\u00fanadan amidst elves and taught\nof his culture, his people; but not of his heritage and name?\"\n\nElrond put out\ndefensive hands. \"Hear me, Gilraen; I do not ask this lightly.\nImladris is a waystation for many travelers of all races; and if a\nsmall mortal child should manage to slip through into places where he\nshould not go at the wrong time, and be sought by us using a name\nrumored to be that of a dead child, it will undo all of the other\narrangements we might make.\"\n\n\"But a child needs to\nknow of his father, to know who he himself is.\" She glared at the\nelf. \"You're asking me to lie to my son.\"\n\n\"No,\" Elrond\nreplied softly, \"I'm not asking you to to tell him falsehoods,\njust not to tell him the entirety of the truth. Your son will never\ndoubt that he is D\u00fanadan, I would not steal that from either of you.\n But until he has the personal strength to deal with the challenges\nand threats that will come his way simply for being Aragorn, that\nname must not be spoken again once our discussions here today are\nconcluded.\"\n\nGilraen subsided back\ninto her chair, the goblet of watered wine forgotten in her hand.\nOnce again, Elrond's argument was unassailable, but that didn't\nstop the ache. She  was  losing her son, only in a very subtle\nway that only a mother would appreciate.\n\nElrond, too, looked as\nif he shared her discontent. The ageless face was clouded with deep\nemotions that Gilraen couldn't begin to understand as he settled\nback into his own chair to ponder. He rubbed a spot between his\neyebrows absently for a long time, obviously deep in thought.\nFinally he raised his head, a light beginning to shine in his grey\neyes again. \"It is a tradition among the Eldar that we sometimes\ngive our children other names by which they are called as they grow;\nin this instance, I think following the tradition of the elves will\nbe the way we can best deal with this. We will find an  epess\u00eb\nfor your son \u2013 one that we can use until the day comes for him to\nreclaim his name, his lineage and his destiny.\"\n\n\"What about knowing\nhis father?\" Gilraen demanded. \"Are you telling me I cannot even\nspeak of my husband to my son?\"\n\nThe grey eyes held an\nocean of compassion in their depths. \"I'm sorry, Gilraen. I\ntold you that some of the necessary sacrifices would be hard ones.\"\n\nThat stung. Gilraen\nclosed her eyes and took another sip of her wine. To see Arathorn so\nclearly in the countenance of her son and yet not be allowed to speak\nof it to him was like a dagger in her mind. What made it worse,\nhowever, is that she could sense the rightness in what Elrond was\nasking of her. It fit with what her own father had told her, that it\nwas her son's survival that mattered above all else. Above  all\nelse, even the need to tell her son of his father.\n\nWhen she opened her\neyes again, she could see Elrond watching her reactions very closely.\n \"I will do as you ask,\" she submitted quietly. \"Even though\nit is as if you ask me to cut out half of my heart, I will do as you\nask.\"\n\n\"I would not ask it\nif the situation were not so grave,\" he told her with an obvious\ntone of sorrow.\n\nNo, Gilraen had to\nadmit to herself, given what she had seen from the Lord of Imladris\nso far, he wouldn't. It didn't make the concession any less\npainful, however. She wiped again at her cheek. \"Do you know what\nyou will call my son?\" she asked, returning to an only slightly\nsafer topic.\n\nElrond's brows\nraised, and he shook his head. \"I fear I have come to no decision\non that as yet. The principle behind assigning an  epess\u00eb  is\nto take characteristics of the individual and craft a name around\nthem. I will have to spend time with your son to adequately see\u2026\"\n\nThe sound of a child's\nlaughter wafted through the openness behind the desk. Elrond's\nhead whipped around sharply when that laughter was answered by soft\nand low adult-sounding chuckles. \"Ai Elbereth!\" he whispered to\nhimself as he rose and strode quickly over to the window to gaze out\ninto the garden. His reaction caught Gilraen by surprise \u2013 she had\nrecognized the child's voice as Aragorn's and the chuckles as\nbeing similar to what she'd heard just that morning from Elladan \u2013\nand she replaced the goblet on the tray and rose to join Elrond in\nobserving what was going on outside the study that had so unsettled\nhim.\n\nThe garden outside the\nstudy was truly beautiful, with a tumult of spring flowers in full\nbloom beneath ancient trees. At the far end of the garden splashed a\nfountain that poured over into a small pond; and in front of that\npond squatted a small child between two much larger minders, one in\nemerald green and the other in deep blue. Elladan had his hand\nfirmly affixed to the collar of Aragorn's shirt while Elrohir was\npointing to something out in the pond that the child was stretching\nand reaching for. The ebony-haired elves looked at each other and\nexchanged gentle words and then broke into easy laughter before\nreturning their attention to their charge.\n\nA soft gasp met\nGilraen's ear, and she turned to see tears running unimpeded down\nElrond's cheek. Slowly he turned his gaze from the garden to the\nstartled young woman at his side. \"I thought I'd never\u2026\"\nOnce more he moved abruptly, striding from her side and over to his\ndesk to retrieve an obviously used goblet from amid the paperwork,\nand then over to the tray to fill that vessel with wine from the\ncarafe.\n\n\"Lord Elrond?\"\nGilraen asked quietly, worried. What was wrong? Had Aragorn done\nsomething\u2026\n\n\"Estel,\" he\npronounced in a shaky voice after taking a very long drink from his\nwine. \"That will be his  epess\u00eb  \u2013 Estel; for with him has\nreturned hope to this house.\"\n\nShe blinked in\nsurprise. \"Excuse me?\"\n\nElrond motioned for\nGilraen to resume her seat, which she did after taking one final\nglance out the window at her little son so very well tended by the\ntwo towering elven warriors. The thought that, perhaps, at least her\nson could be happy here brought a small smile to her lips. She then\nreturned to in front of the hearth and perched herself on the edge of\nher seat, concerned at the strange outpouring of emotion from her\nhost that, on observation, didn't seem to be abating as yet. \"Is\neverything all right with you, my Lord?\" She didn't dare reach\nout to him, although she suspected he was as much in need of comfort\nas she ever had been since her nightmare began.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he\nbegan, shaking his head slightly. \"I just hadn't expected\u2026\"\nElrond visibly and with some difficulty worked to reclaim his\ncomposure, wiping away the tears with an unapologetic hand and then\ntaking another healthy sip of the wine. \"My apologies, Lady. I'm\nnot normally so easily provoked to strong emotions this early in the\nday.\"\n\n\"What was it?\"\nGilraen just had to know.\n\n\"I heard my sons\nlaughing,\" Elrond stated simply in a voice in which the deep\nemotions still stirred vigorously. Gilraen blinked, still not\nunderstanding how such a simple thing would inspire such a strong\nresponse, and he sighed deeply before continuing. \"Many, many\nyears ago, my wife\u2026\" His voice caught, and she found herself\nholding her breath. \"My wife was captured by orcs and tortured.\"\n\nGilraen closed her eyes\nand felt her heart squeeze painfully. He hadn't said \"killed,\"\nhe'd said \"captured and tortured.\" How much worse must that\nhave been! At least Arathorn's death, although shocking and\naltogether too soon, had been swift \u2013 he hadn't suffered.\n\nElrond continued on,\nhis voice bleak. \"My sons found her and brought her home to me.\nIt was a miracle she'd survived at all; but as it turned out, I\ncould only heal her body. Her  fae , her spirit, had been too\nbadly broken by what she'd endured before she was rescued. She\ncouldn't remain in Middle-earth, and she took ship. My sons blamed\nthemselves \u2013 and me, I suppose \u2013 for their Naneth's injuries\nand need to depart; and they became very angry. For centuries now,\nthey have exorcised their fury on the Enemy's minions, hunting them\nrelentlessly and spending almost all their time in battle.\"\n\nHe gazed in the\ndirection of the garden and the sounds of gentle conversation and yet\nmore laughter. \"I've seldom seen them in the time since then;\nand always, when they came home, were they somber and lifeless.\nOften, they were badly injured, and rarely would they share the\ndetails of what had happened to them as I repaired their bodies only\nto know they'd leave again as soon as they were healed enough to\ntravel. I've often wondered, as they would ride away yet again\nfrom here to continue their personal war of revenge, if I would ever\nsee them again on this side of the Sundering Sea. When I first saw\nthem last night, they were cold and wet and tired and heart-sick at\nwhat had happened to their friend and comrade, and concerned when you\ncollapsed almost the moment of their arrival. To see them today,\nsuddenly, healthy and whole in my garden, laughing and taking\npleasure in the company of a small child is as if the last five\nhundred years had been an evil dream.\" Long fingers wiped away\nmore tears before they could fall this time. \"It's like seeing\nthe warm sun of Spring after a very long and fell winter.\"\n\nGilraen stared. He\n knew . He'd lost too, and lost dearly. The need to\nsacrifice in the name of duty was something that Elrond knew all too\nwell. For the first time since she'd been introduced to the tall,\nelven warriors who had become her husband's battle advisors and\ncomrades-in-arms, she began to appreciate what had driven them to the\nlengths they had taken. She'd seen several of the younger men of\nher village end up on a similar path over the few years she'd spent\nhearing of such things.\n\n\"This is why I shall\ncall your son Estel, for he has brought the hope of healing back into\nmy house,\" Elrond continued in a thoughtful tone. \"He is the\nhope of your people too, so the name fits on a number of levels.\"\nThe Elf Lord took a long and stabilizing breath before turning a\nrapidly calming gaze on her. \"Does my choice meet with your\napproval?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered\nquietly, knowing now that the choice of  epess\u00eb  held meaning\nfor the both of them. That he was asking her permission to assign\nthat name before making it official made her feel better, as if she\nwere having some say in what would happen after believing herself\ncompletely powerless. His rapidly clearing gaze told her he was\nquickly reclaiming his calm and serenity, but she gazed at him with\nopen concern. \"Will you be all right, my Lord?\"\n\n\"I think, perhaps\u2026\"\n He rose and extended his hand to her. \"\u2026that unless there is\nsomething else you feel we need to discuss immediately, I would like\nto spend some time in my garden with my sons \u2013 and with your son,\nif you don't mind. Would you like to join me?\"\n\n\"I would be honored,\"\nshe answered and allowed him to pull her to her feet again and tuck\nher hand into the bend in his elbow.\n\nElrohir had been right.\n This interview, while difficult, hadn't been half as bad as she'd\nfeared. Elrond himself was far less intimidating than she'd\nexpected.

King Stag    Prologue: Thoughts Of A Dry Brain\n \"Thou hast nor youth nor age\nBut as it were an after dinner sleep\nDreaming of both.\"\nTS Eliot, Gerontion\n For the past two hours, Thranduil Oropherion had sat with his back resting against the broad bole of an ancient oak, wineskin in hand, watching his woods fill up with snow. The snow had ceased now, the storm moving off to the east, and the stars had come out in the moonless sky. He felt older than the oak, which indeed he was, and yet those stars had not changed from the well-remembered patterns of his earliest youth.  He hefted the wineskin and took another deep draught. No, not enough yet for tonight's purposes, judging from the weight of what remained and the stubborn clarity in his head. Had he ever been young? Had he ever felt free of care? So hard to remember . . .    Chapter One: A Thousand Small Deliberations    \"Now go to your wife. Take her to her parents and make it right with them, as a man should . . . .\"   Easier said than done, Thranduil thought, as he followed his wife of less than a day along the steep mountain path, with Oropher's parting words still ringing in his memory. The aromatic pine fragrance of the Emyn Duir filled his nostrils, the soft whisper of the wind through the branches filled his ears, and trepidation filled his heart. Oh, why had he not kept his head? Had be been more in control of himself, more prudent, as the son of a king ought to be, he would be bringing Lalaithiel's father a dead deer or whatever it was that these  Evyr  gave as a polite bridal offering, rather than coming before him to make amends.  Perhaps they won't notice, he told himself, and just as quickly discarded the thought. Helegui, his father's seneschal, had noticed and scowled down his bladelike nose. Galion had noticed and laughed, telling Thranduil it was high time. The  Laegrim  had winked and grinned, and the  Iathrim  had raised their aristocratic eyebrows at the untoward behavior of their prince. Oropher himself had been surprisingly decent about it, but not a one of them had failed to notice how things had changed when Thranduil and Lalaithiel came out of the woods together that morning. His wife's parents could hardly be any different.  Watching Lalaithiel's slender body as she walked in front of him, Thranduil felt an overpowering urge to rush ahead, take her by the waist and carry her into the bushes for more of the delightful pastime in which they had passed the previous night. His breath, already rapid from the exertion of the hike, quickened as he envisioned her writhing beneath him in passion, and above him and . . .  'Now, you see, that is the same brilliant thinking that has brought you to this sorry pass,'  said a small voice of reason inside his head, a voice that had been too silent of late. Had it been a little louder last night, or had Thranduil been more of a mind to pay it heed, he would now be going before his beloved's parents in courtesy to ask for her hand in marriage, rather than presenting that marriage as a fait accompli. It would surely not help matters to bring her to them with the tips of her ears still pink and her lips bruised from a recent tupping.\n Who could blame him, though? His love for this girl had hit him blindside with the suddenness of a thunderclap in a summer tempest. Thranduil had been long unwed. Galion had married young. Galion's children had married young, and his children's children in turn, until Thranduil had lost track of his friend's progeny, and yet the same joy never seemed to happen for Thranduil. The  ennin  passed, and Thranduil saw Oropher eyeing him sidelong, as if the king felt his son might be turned to the love of other males. Thranduil knew this was not the case. He desired women fiercely -- always, it was some faceless elf-maiden he pictured as he lay nights alone with his own hand -- yet never did he meet one with whom he wanted to spend eternity. At length he wondered if there might be something wrong with him and decided that life as a family man was not to be his fate. Until one morning when, out pursuing a stag, he had stumbled upon a girl bathing in a forest pool, and since that moment his heart had not been his own. His mind neither.  On the night she accepted his betrothal token and agreed to become his, too many long-years of loneliness and pent up need had broken over him like a tidal wave rushing across the land, sweeping away duty, virtue, and wisdom itself. A future life without her was unimaginable, and he felt his heart clench at the thought that, even now, he might lose her.  \"Whatever is amiss with you, you great royal fool?\" Thranduil came out of his musings to see that Lalaithiel had stopped, turned and stood staring at him, hand on hip. \"You look as if you were heading to your own execution, rather than to meet my mother and my father.\"  Thranduil was not so sure that an execution would not be the case. \"What if they don't like me?\" he asked lamely.  \"How could they not?\" she laughed.  Easily, Thranduil thought. Of late, some dwarves in Moria disliked him intensely, and Thranduil knew he was lucky to have escaped that incident with his life. There were some among his father's nobles who found him a disappointment for precisely the sort of rash behavior that had taken him alone into Moria, and the lack of judgment which brought him before Lalaithiel's parents now. \"Your father would be well within his rights to have me thrashed,\" he said unhappily.  Lalaithiel merely snorted and rolled her pale grey eyes. He loved that about her -- her utter lack of awe for the fact he was the son of the elf who called himself king of this land, and her readiness to mock him whenever he took himself too seriously. \"If I recall aright, it was I who first said the vows and I who first kissed you, thus.\" She stepped forward to show him, thus, and pressed into him. \"I have a mind of my own, Thranduil,\" she teased. \"And who could resist me when I am bent upon something I want?\"  Thranduil sighed, enjoying the sensation of her body against his. \"Only someone with far more self-control than I.\" He exercised what little self-control he had now, setting her gently away from him, or else he really would take her to her people fresh from a tumbling. \"So tell me, wife,\" he said letting the new and unfamiliar word roll off his tongue as if he were tasting a sweetmeat, \"how much farther do we have to go before we reach your home?\"  \"No farther,\" she said. \"We are here.\"  Thranduil blinked to clear his vision and looked around. Had not Lalaithiel made him look more closely, he might have missed the strange dwellings entirely, clad as they were in bark and roofed in leaves that made them fade into the background of the forest. How very unlike his father's own palace, which looked as is if had grown out of the earth, yet stood proudly and plainly visible against the trees that surrounded it. \"Oh, this is marvelous!\" he whispered.  As he spoke the words, an elf-woman, dressed in green and brown hues that made her nigh unto invisible against the foliage, materialized out of the woods, carrying a leather bucket. \"Please, allow me,\" Thranduil said, rushing to relieve her of her burden. \"Where would you like me to put this?\"  The woman nodded toward one of the huts. \"Next to the house will do.\" She looked from Lalaithiel to Thranduil and back again. \"Well, daughter,\" she said finally, raising one dark eyebrow. \"I see you have taken yourself a man. Is he of any use -- besides hauling water, that is?\"  Thranduil saw the tips of his wife's ears flush. \"I have no complaints,  Am\u00e8h ,\" she said.  The other woman nodded. She raised her voice and called out, \"She's home, T\u00fbron, and she was not eaten by a warg.\"  A tall elf-man came out of the hut's door, bending his head as he went beneath the lintel. He seemed to have been cooking, Thranduil thought, for he smelled of charcoal and roasting meat, and he wiped his hands on a piece of rough cloth as he approached. He also looked from Thranduil to Lalaithiel and back again several times, but said nothing, although the expression on his face made it plain he understood the situation.  He went first to his daughter and laid his head against her forehead in an unmistakable gesture of affection. He drew back then, pausing to run through his fingers the necklace of mithril and moonstones that Thranduil had fastened at Lalaithiel's throat the night before. \"Very pretty. But you can't eat it.\"  Thranduil swallowed. Oropher had congratulated him this morning for winning the allegiance of the Forest Folk all in one night. He now had a feeling that his father might have been overly optimistic.  \" At\u00e8h, Am\u00e8h , this is Thranduil.\"  \"I am T\u00fbron,\" said the man gravely.  \"And I am N\u00eewel,\" added the woman.  Looking at his wife's parents, Thranduil could see traces of Lalaithiel in each -- her pale grey eyes from her father, her delicate beauty and dark hair from her mother. Even clad in humble garb, the couple had an unmistakable majesty about them.  \" H\u00eer Adar ,\" said Thranduil, bowing ceremoniously. He turned to N\u00eewel. \" Hiril Naneth .\"  \"Well, daughter,\" said T\u00fbron, thawing just the slightest, \"you've chosen yourself a mannerly one, I will grant him that.\"  \"And a pretty one too,\" chimed in N\u00eewel. \"Where ever did you get that hair, Prince?\"  Thranduil had no idea where his bright golden hair had come from. Growing up and looking around among the folk of his father's realm he had seen nothing but shades of black and dark brown like Galion's hair, or silver, and pale flaxen like Oropher's. Never a one who looked like him, and he had come at long last to think of himself as the sole cuckoo in the nest. But more surprising to him was N\u00eewel's use of his title.  \"Do not wonder at this, lad,\" said T\u00fbron, noting his startled look. \"We may live simply, but that does not mean we are ignorant fools or live with our heads in our--\" he paused as N\u00eewel cleared her throat and gave him a sharp look, \"ah . . . armpits. I knew you were courting our daughter, and I have long been curious as to what brought a prince of the Grey-elves among those whom your folk call the  Evyr .\"  Evyr , the Unwilling. Thranduil knew this was the term his father's  Iathrim  used for the strange folk who had come west following the destruction of Cuivienen. Dark-elves, they called them when being less polite, despite that fact that their own great king, Thingol, had bridled at the term. Thingol, who alone of the Grey-elves had seen the light of the Trees and had turned from it, remaining in Ennor for love. Thranduil would show he was made of the same stuff.\n \"I am as  Morben  as you,\" he said solemnly. \"I love Lalaithiel, and I would die for her.\"  \"Is that your lover-name for her?\" said T\u00fbron, with a smile. \"Well-spoken, for I see you know her heart. There is not a man among us, Thara-ndhul, who in the first days of taking a woman to be his own, does not say the same thing -- that he is willing to die for her. The question, son, is are you willing to live for her?\"  Thranduil raised an eyebrow and shook his head. \"What do you mean?\"  \"Your father came east to find a simpler life and to live as elves should. Are you willing, Thara-ndhul, to follow that path to its end?\"  \"I am willing to do whatever it takes to be a proper husband to Lalaithiel and to show honor to her folk,\" Thranduil replied solemnly.  \"Indeed,\" T\u00fbron said. \"Are you willing to undergo our manhood ceremonies and become one of us? This would be only courteous for one who wishes to take one of our women to wife.\"  Thranduil began to nod earnestly, until a worrisome thought crossed his mind. He had heard disquieting rumors of the strange customs of the Forest Folk. \"These rites do not involve, ah, cutting anything off, do they?\" Beside him, Lalaithiel let out her tinkling laugh, and N\u00eewel snorted softly.  T\u00fbron merely quirked his lip. \"No, son -- not even your princely braid.\" As Thranduil relaxed, he continued, \"I cannot promise it will be entirely painless. But what is a little pain if the prize is worth having?\"  Thranduil smiled wanly. 'Heh, right -- what's a little pain?\"  As Thranduil and T\u00fbron conversed, elves with curious eyes had come drifting out of huts and the surrounding forest. They now had quite an audience. A rustle in the tree branches made Thranduil look up, as three young men dropped to the forest floor.  \"What are they doing?\" he asked, as each of them untied a brace of dead squirrels from his belt and cast them on the ground.  \"They have been out hunting,\" N\u00eewel said. \"Sometimes, when the terrain is rough, it is swifter to travel through the tree-tops.\"  \"You can do that?\" Thranduil had never seen the like of it, not even among the  Laegrim .  \"Any elf worthy of the name ought to be able to run along the branches,\" T\u00fbron said dismissively, although Thranduil noted that Lalaithiel gave her father a warning glance.  Any elf worthy of the name, indeed! \"Then so can I,\" Thranduil said, rising to the implied challenge in T\u00fbron's voice.  \"Is that so? Very well, then; climb up into the branches and run from this tree over to that one.\" T\u00fbron indicated two trees on either side of the settlement, about half an arrow's flight apart. This earned him a disapproving look from his wife and a gasp of dismay from Lalaithiel. \"At least I am sending him across the commons, not out over the ravine,\" he said peevishly.  \"I will be all right,\" Thranduil reassured his wife. \"I can do this.\" He strode confidently over to the first tree T\u00fbron had indicated, a massive oak, and leapt high, swinging himself up onto its lowest branch. He stood, balancing himself lightly.  The forest in these parts was mixed hardwood and pine, and the branches of the oaks and beeches intertwined thickly. Thranduil planned his route to the other side, moving in a slight half circle to avoid several pines whose sloping branches could not possibly support him. He saw only a few sparse spots where he would have to leap a void. He was a strong runner, he told himself; he could manage it with ease.  \"What are you waiting for?\" he heard T\u00fbron say, and he sprang forth, running out along the branch until he felt it dip beneath his weight. He leapt up and to the left, aiming for a main branch on a big beech. This time he proceeded in to the center, up slightly and out again to the periphery. Again came another oak, with its branch slightly lower and with a longer jump required to reach it. Thranduil sprang and came down again, moving in past the massive trunk and out to the end of yet another branch.  'This is fun, ' he told himself, just before he felt nothing but thin air beneath his feet and he saw the ground come rushing up at him with alarming speed.  o o o  The next thing Thranduil felt, as he struggled his way up from blackness, was the sensation of cold on his cheeks and forehead. He opened his eyes to see the worried face of his wife peering down at him. Lalaithiel had a bucket beside her, the very bucket he had carried for her mother, and her cupped hand still held some of the water she had been splashing on him.  \" Huitho ,\" he muttered weakly. Immediately he heard a burst of female laughter from across the clearing, and, struggling to bring his vision into focus, he saw the men, T\u00fbron among them, shaking their heads in disgust.  \"I'm fine, fine -- just got the wind knocked out of me,\" Thranduil said, moving his arms and legs experimentally one by one to discover if it were actually true. Everything seemed to be working, and there were no outrageously sharp bursts of pain in his limbs. So far, so good. He sat up and immediately sank back down again with a groan.  Lalaithiel took his head in her lap and stroked his hair, making little cooing noises. Thranduil stared up at the green canopy of leaves until T\u00fbron's face filled his field of vision.  \"Do you still think you have the strength and courage to undergo our rites, son of Orn\u00e2pheren?\" he asked, looking decidedly unimpressed at his new son-in-law's performance thus far.  \"Aye,  H\u00eer Adar ,\" Thranduil said, trying his utmost not to let it come out in a bleat. \"Just tell me the time and the place.\"  He swore he could see the faintest ghost of a smile on T\u00fbron's face. \"Very well, then, Thara-ndhul. Right here. Tonight. There is no point in waiting.\""}

I\nwasn't expecting you.\"\n\nShe could hear steps\napproaching, and the sound of furniture moving. No doubt Elessar was\npulling his chair closer to hers. \"I'm not surprised,\"\nAragorn replied easily, already sitting down, from the sound of his\nvoice. \"Legolas' message said that you had refused to let him\nsummon me before now, but that he was ready to suffer your\ndispleasure after your latest incident. I'm glad he sent for me,\nhowever; because from the looks of things, you need...\"\n\n\"It's good to have\nyou here,\" she smiled, \"if for no other reason than to have\nnews of the outside world. But you needn't worry on my behalf - I'll\nbe fine. You'd think Legolas would be used to the trials and\ntribulations enjoyed by mortals by now.\" She sighed to herself.\n Of course Legolas would have summoned Aragorn after her collapse in\na hallway a week earlier, a collapse for which Gelinnas, his healer,\ncould find no outward cause. It also should have been obvious that\nwhen Gelinnas wouldn't allow her out of bed for more than trips to\nthe privy or the baths, she was being nursed and coddled until her\nofficial healer arrived.\n\nAragorn was silent for\na moment. \"I doubt he expected to see this particular malady\nfrom you, since it normally applies more to his own kind than ours.\nBesides, Elves are tender-hearted souls who tend to worry a great\ndeal and summon healers at need,\" the King quipped, \"especially\nwhen their charges fall senseless in the middle of a busy walkway.\"\n\nThough he might be High\nKing in Minas Anor, Elara never perceived Aragorn as anything than a\nhealer when he came to Ithilien. He never treated her with anything\nbut respect and courtesy, and never allowed her to treat him as\nanything more than just another member of Legolas' Elven household.\nHis visits were infrequent as a rule, but once the formalities of\nletting him assess her condition as a healer were concluded, he would\nbecome the good friend.\n\n\"I suppose I\nshouldn't be surprised he'd send for you,\" Elara sighed gently\nand placed the slender metal needle into the fabric in such a way\nthat it would be easy to find again and then topped it with her\nrawhide thimble. \"I just think he worries too much about me\nwhen he has a realm to run.\"\n\nLegolas, for all his\nlight-heartedness and soft-spoken ways, was very much Thranduil's\nson. He had his father's slyly twisted sense of humor, Thranduil's\ndedication and loyalty to his lands and the Elves who called him\n\"Lord,\" and, sadly, his father's ability to sink into\nalmost inconsolable moods, especially when the sea-longing would take\nhold. The similarities between father and son had made the necessary\nmove from Eryn Lasgalen a little easier, and wrenching at the same\ntime. She had been grateful when Legolas had gladly taken her,\ngrieving and blind, into his hall; and she knew he'd worked patiently\nto try to make her once more find reason to smile in a land far away\nfrom where she'd left her heart.\n\nNo doubt he was\nbeginning to worry now, for his efforts had little effect in the five\nyears she'd been in residence. Elara tended to remain silent and\nwithdrawn more often than not, and she knew she was difficult to lure\nout to join the community at the evening meals without a direct\ninvitation and determined escort. And while she had joined the\ncircle of seamstresses and broideresses and worked diligently for the\ngood of the realm, she rarely spoke to anyone beyond the necessary.\n\n\"Be reasonable.\nHe takes his promise to his father to safeguard your welfare very\nseriously, as do I; and your collapse tells him he needs to give you\nmore attention, not less.\" Aragorn's hand reached out for hers,\nas she expected - his fingers lingering on her pulse. \"Tell me,\nnow: how is your appetite?\"\n\n\"I eat enough,\"\nshe answered quickly. She had long since lost any interest in eating\nany more than absolutely necessary, and she knew she had probably\nlost weight since the last time Aragorn saw her.\n\n\"To barely keep\nyou alive, you mean,\" was the wry response. \"With all due\nrespect, a stiff wind would blow you half-way to Rohan. I spoke to\nthe cook in the kitchens, incidentally, so I know how much you are\nand aren't eating. Are you in pain?\"\n\n\"No, Sire,\"\nshe replied easily. \"I tire walking back and forth from my\napartment to the solar where the seamstresses meet of a day now, and\nlately I sometimes find it hard to catch my breath, but there is no\npain.\"\n\n\"If you ate more,\nthis would not be an issue; and I told you, Elara, my name is\nAragorn. Save the formal title for when you come to visit Minas\nTirith.\"\n\n\"It isn't right\nthat a wood-gatherer's daughter should be on such an informal basis\nwith the High King of...\"\n\nAragorn snorted and\nshushed her protest brusquely. \"You are no mere wood-gatherer's\ndaughter, and haven't been since the day the Elves found you in that\nburned-out village, and you know it. Besides, if I ever treated you\nas if you were a common wood-gatherer's wife or daughter, I'd not\nonly lose my refuge from the Gondorian court here but have the army\nof Eryn Lasgalen pounding at the gates of my City demanding\nsatisfaction. My mother didn't raise me to be a fool.\"\n\nAragorn scooted his\nchair closer yet, and Elara flinched in surprise when his long\nfingers began seeking the place in her neck where her pulse could be\nsensed and then resting there for a long moment. \"Have I ever\ntold you what happened when I finally met with King Thranduil in Eryn\nLasgalen after the war, not too long after you arrived here in\nIthilien? He threatened to put my 'obscenely round' ears - as he\ncalled them - in a glass jar on his desk for endangering his son\nyears ago on the Quest! I'm certain you remember what a loud voice\nhe has when he gets angry...\"\n\nElara snorted. That\nsounded very much like the Thranduil she knew and loved.\n\n\"I learned that\nday  never  to cross him or endanger anyone he cares about - and\nyou...\"\n\nElara shook her head.\n\"Let's not discuss that, please\" She leaned her head back\nand let that action hide her swallowing back tears that came all too\neasily nowadays.\n\nAragorn's gentle touch\non her upper arm told her that he understood. \"And yet, that's\nwhat this is all about, isn't it? When all is said and done, Elara,\nthere's very little I can do to help the underlying causes of your\naffliction. I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"I know,\" she\nwhispered, her eyes closed in an effort to rein in her emotions yet\nagain. \"It's not your fault.\"\n\nIt hurt to think of\nThranduil more than once in a day. Five years she had been in\nIthilien now, five long, lonesome, agonizing years had passed since\nleaving Eryn Lasgalen. But once safely removed to Ithilien, she\ndiscovered her situation had not improved at all, but gotten\ngenuinely worse. She still listened futilely for Thranduil's deep\nvoice to echo through the hall and waited for a soft brush against\nthe back of her mind that told her he cared - a mental caress that,\nby mutual agreement, he no longer made so as not to injure her\nfurther. The lack of his physical presence, which would have\notherwise balanced those insubstantial things she'd lost, proved\ncorrosive, however; and gradually a hole opened in her heart that,\nunless something changed drastically, would eventually claim her\nlife.\n\n\"Legolas fears you\nare finally fading, and I am going to have to tell him that he's\ncorrect.\"\n\n\"I know,\"\nElara said again in a soft voice. She had already accepted this; it\nwas taking those around her a little longer to understand, that was\nall. \"Perhaps it's for the best, though.\" She brushed at\nthe gentle hand, knocking it from its probing and testing. \"Enough.\n There is little left in this world for me now.\"\n\n\"Don't be\nridiculous. You're very young yet...\"\n\nShe laughed, her voice\nbrittle in her own ears. \"To you, perhaps. But then, you're\nD\u00fanedain, with the blood of the Firstborn in you and more than\nthrice my age already. But the number of years I carry makes no\ndifference. I know the seasons of my life are nearly spent now, and\nI think I'm glad of it.\"\n\n\"What do you\nexpect me to tell Thranduil?\"\n\nShe was quiet for a\nmoment. \"Tell him nothing. He needs no further worries to\nclutter his day.\"\n\nAragorn sighed, and she\nknew he would write anyway, despite her wishes. \"There is a tea\nI want you to use...\"\n\n\"Aragorn.\"\nElara's voice was soft and serene and absolute. \"No.\"\n\n\"Listen to me! It\nisn't a cure or even an attempt at one - you and I both know there  is\nno cure for you that can come from a healer's pouch - but this\ndraught will ease you when your heart labors too hard.\" Aragorn\nhad her hand again, holding it tightly and putting all his\nconsiderable powers of persuasion to work. \"Indulge your\nsovereign, please? Take the tea when you falter, and let it soothe\nyou.\"\n\nIt was Elara's turn to\nsigh. \"You're only prolonging the inevitable, you know.\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\nI'm soothing those hurts that I know can be addressed with medicine.\nWhy suffer needlessly when ease is so readily available? If you are\ndetermined to fade, nothing will stop you. All this will do is to\nmake things less painful in the meanwhile.\"\n\nShe sighed again. She\nshould know better than to argue with him - with any King, for that\nmatter. \"You're impossible.\"\n\nShe could hear Aragorn\nbreathe out a heavy sigh of relief. \"As if you are any less\nimpossible yourself. You and Thranduil must have made quite the\npair, I'm sorry I missed it. Here.\" He took one hand, turned\nit over and put a small, linen pouch in it. \"Keep this with\nyou. I'll give instructions to Gelinnas for making more. Steep the\ncontents of this pouch for three minutes in a mug of boiling water,\nthen add cold water until you can finish the whole thing quickly.\nExpect to sleep for a few hours, and awaken without pain.\"\n\nElara nodded. Legolas'\nhealer would make certain she was kept well-stocked with this newest\nmedicine, whether she wanted it or not. \"So. Are you finished\nwith the poking and prodding now?\"\n\nShe felt Aragorn back\noff a bit, then heard him chuckle again. \"And they say healers\nmake the worst patients. Yes, I'm finished.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\nElara smiled again and leaned forward in his direction to feel for\nand then grasp his hand in her empty one. \"Now you can tell me\nall your news. Tell me about little Eldarion. He must be getting so\nbig now! And what news of the hobbits? Are Arwen and the baby with\nyou this time?\"\n\nThese were things that\nshe knew Aragorn would speak about freely and gladly, and were the\nbest way to move past this necessary fussing to get to the kind of\nchatter that would take her mind off of the dull ache in her chest\nthat simply didn't want to go away anymore. With any luck at all,\nshe wouldn't need his herbs too often before the end. But in the\nmeanwhile, she would enjoy her visit with her friend.\n\noOoOo\n\nThe sweetness of Spring\nprogressed smoothly into the warm stillness of Summer, past a quiet\nMidSummer celebration spent sitting contentedly alone in a private\ngarden rather than at the edge of a crowd of dancing Elves that\nreminded her a little too much of dancing in another wood far to the\nnorth, and then moved into the growing chill of Autumn.\n\nThe late Autumn morning\nhad dawned with the oppressive warmth of a left-over Summer day, and\nElara decided to spend the day outside. Now that she could no longer\nwalk the corridors to join the sewing circle, her work had been\nbrought to her room and then reclaimed in the evening; and after\nseveral very chilly days, it would be pleasant to spend her time\nsewing with the warmth of the sun on her face. She donned a knitted\nshawl that would keep her warm should the breeze rise, gathered her\nday's work and shuffled through the door and out onto the flagstones\nof the private garden she shared with Legolas himself.\n\nThere was a grand old\noak tree on the very edge of the garden that abutted Elara's\napartment, and Elara slowly made her way around the boundary of the\ngarden to it, following and leaning hard on the low rail Legolas had\ninstalled to help guide her steps. She carefully laid the pile of\nsewing materials on the ground at her feet, then unfolded the thin\nblanket she had retrieved from the chest at the foot of her bed and\nshook it out, letting it fall to the ground as it would. Then she\nsank to her knees onto it, felt around until she had her sewing work\ngathered into her lap, and then let her back rest against the sturdy\ntrunk with a tired sigh. This walk was almost beyond her now too;\nanother small joy to let go of as she stepped back from life. She\nwould enjoy her time in the garden today all the more for it being\nher last time, she decided.\n\nOnly here, leaning\nagainst this particular tree, could she sense that subtle pulsing\nthat had been so easily felt in the Greenwood. Legolas, as his\nfather had done before him on a MidSummer's day years earlier, had\ntried to introduce her to the trees of Ithilien; but only this one\noak continued to speak to her when she was alone. Since then, the\nfriendly oak had become her refuge within a refuge. She came here\nnow on warmer days to sew, to dream, to remember, to grieve and weep,\nand to rest a mind weary of the trivial banter that only loosely\nconcerned her.\n\nThe oak comforted her\nas best it could, its voice almost too soft to be heard clearly, but\nits intentions and sympathy made a seat at its base a favorite place\nfor a displaced and heart-sick mortal. She'd already decided that\nwhen the time came, this would be where she would ask Legolas to let\nher body rest until the breaking of the world, the one place most\nlike where she'd left her heart. Knowing she would return here\neventually helped make the thought of not returning here again on her\nown power a bit less painful.\n\nAs she relaxed and let\nthe sounds of the garden soothe her to the extent that they could,\nshe could hear the distant sound of excitement that normally\naccompanied the arrival of a visitor to the hall. Elara had heard\nnothing from either Gelinnas or Legolas of anyone being expected, so\nshe sighed and let go of the thought. Whoever it was would be of no\nconcern of hers, and it was easy enough nowadays to stay in her\napartment and avoid any and all guests entirely. Strangely enough,\nthe tree against which she leaned seemed to stir slightly as well,\nalthough not enough to keep her from slipping into a light doze. It\nwas so easy to fall sleep while sewing nowadays, and so much more\npeaceful to stay that way. Perhaps one day she'd fall asleep and\nnever wake up again - but in the meanwhile, she'd enjoy the dreams.\n\nThe dream that took her\nthis warm day was her favorite. Her nose filled with the scent of\nwarm forest and sweet, fresh-cut grass, and she seemed to move from\nthe darkness of sleep to hear the steady thrumming of a heartbeat in\nher ear. Then it was as if she was back in the depths of the\nElvenking's hall, in a chair in front of a crackling fire on a cold,\nstormy winter night, snuggled comfortably into Thranduil's warm arms.\n She had relived that precious moment of time wherein she and her\nElven lord had laid their hearts open to the other many, many times\nsince that night, each time coming away from the memory both\ncomforted and grieving.\n\nIt was odd, however,\nfor her to have such dreams on warm autumn afternoons.\n\nStill, she wasn't above\nmaking the most of it, for the dreams about that defining moment in\nher life rarely lasted much longer than the actual moment in time had\nlasted in reality, and she hadn't dreamed this dream for well over a\nyear. She drew in a deep breath of that much-loved scent that even\nafter five years still meant security and caring and then let it go\nin a sigh of contentment. \"Thranduil,\" she murmured very\nsoftly, speaking to her dream. \"You haven't visited me like\nthis for a long time.\"\n\nThe arms that held her\nstiffened for a moment and then pulled her just a little closer.\n\"Oh, Elara  n\u00een !\" replied a deep voice that she only\nbarely remembered while awake and yet thrilled to hear in her dreams,\n\"I came as soon as I could.\" The regret and sadness in\nthat rich voice shimmered like a jewel spinning in the air.\n\nElara shook her head\nagainst the soft suede of his tunic - wait, didn't he normally wear a\nvelvet robe and silken sleeping shirt in the dream, just as he had\nthat night? \"Don't worry,\" she mumbled, deciding not to\nworry about dream trivialities. She took in another deep breath of\nthe beloved scent and settled a bit more comfortably against the\nsolid chest. \"Now let's just get on with the dream, shall we?\nYou know this is the only thing that comforts me anymore.\"\n\n\"My poor gift! I\nhave been such an inadequate steward for you,\" the deep voice\ngrieved over her, still refusing to follow known and expected paths\nof conversation. \"I promised to share the seasons of your life;\nand instead, I squandered our precious time together. Look at you -\nyou're barely more than a shadow!\"\n\n\"You didn't say\nanything like that back then,\" Elara grumbled and shifted\nslightly against the restraining arms in frustration, swatting\nlightly at the oddly-garbed chest. \"Stop it. This is supposed\nto be my favorite memory.\"\n\n\"I am no memory,\nno dream, Elara. I'm real. Awaken now,\" the deep voice called\nto her.\n\n\"I don't want to,\"\nshe complained, snuggling tighter to her dream-Thranduil's chest as\nif it would protect her. \"When I am awake, I'm always alone. I\ndon't want to be alone anymore.\"\n\n\"No longer, my\ngift. Awaken. I'm here. You're not alone.\" The arms that\nheld her shook her gently.\n\nElara frowned, rousing\nslightly. This wasn't the way her comfortable last day beneath her\noak was supposed to go. Already she felt bereft, denied the one\ndream she craved above all others. \"Hmmm?\"\n\n Elara n\u00een. Awaken,\nplease.   The deep mental voice resonated clearly in the corners\nof her mind that had for too long been silent.\n\nThat definitely didn't\nbelong to any familiar dream, and she once more tried to stir - only\nto find herself restrained in fact. It took waking up a little\nfurther to realize that she really was being held by someone, and\nheld tightly. \"What?\" she whimpered, pulling her arms to\nher body defensively and then pushing against the one who held her.\n\"Who... Let me go...\"\n\n\"Hush, you are\nsafe.\" Lips trailed across her forehead as they had once so\nlong ago. \"It is I, Elara. I'm here.\"\n\n\"Thran...\nThranduil?\" She breathed in again, and the scent of warm forest\nand fresh-cut grass still hung close in the air, although now\naccompanied by what she suspected was the scent of sweaty horse and\nplenty of dust. It seemed impossible, but the intrusion of scents\nthat normally didn't belong to her dream began to convince her that\nshe truly wasn't dreaming. \"You're really here? This isn't...\"\n Then she was in motion, turning swiftly in his embrace and throwing\nher arms around his neck and holding on tightly, not caring in the\nleast that she wasn't supposed to do this. \"Thranduil!\"\n\n\"Elara!\" he\nsighed and breathed out a sigh of relief as he clasped her tightly to\nhim in return, his face buried in her neck.\n\nShe wasn't listening to\nanything except the rich timbre of the deep voice she had thought\nnever to hear again except in dreams, and she sobbed at the thought\nthat this might be nothing more than the consequence of too much sun.\n Suddenly it was overwhelming, and the dull ache in her chest\nblossomed into white-hot agony. Elara let out a strangled cry and\nfell back, hands clutching at her chest, struggling to breathe.\n\nThranduil heaved\nbeneath her, catching her up in his arms with a cry of his own that\nturned into an agonized bellow for his son as he ran with Elara\ntoward the hall. She heard Legolas try to soothe his father as he\nrushed past him into the still and somewhat cooler air of an\napartment that hadn't quite warmed yet in the unseasonable weather.\n\"I had Gelinnas prepare for this possibility the moment I heard\nyou had arrived. There is a draught ready for her that should give\nher ease. This has happened before. Sit down, Father - no, it's\nbetter if you hold her sitting upright for now. It helps her to\nbreathe. I'll fetch the draught for you.\"\n\nFor once, Elara was\ngrateful for the dreadful-tasting concoction that Aragorn prescribed\nfor her. Thranduil settled her once more into his lap, held the mug\nto her lips until she'd swallowed the entire contents, and then\ncradled her head against his shoulder with a long-fingered hand,\nalternately murmuring reassurances to her and berating himself for\nsomething she didn't quite understand. She knew that the draught\nmade her sleepy rather quickly, but fought it. \"S..s..sorry,\"\nshe managed finally. \"N..no way t..to greet...\"\n\n\"Don't try to\ntalk,\" the King hushed at her. \"Rest. We'll talk later,\nwhen you feel better.\"\n\nWith no energy to do\notherwise, Elara relaxed into an embrace she'd believed she'd never\nknow again - her grip on the soft suede of his tunic her one\nconcession to her fear that this truly was nothing more than a dream.\n What was he doing here? Why had he come? Did it matter? He was\nhere, and he was holding her as he had that night. As the expected\nslumber began to numb her mind, she stirred. \"D...don't\nleave...\" she whispered.\n\n\"I will be here\nwhen you awaken, I promise,\" he reassured her. \"Sleep\nnow.\"\n\noOoOo\n\nIt was like reliving\nthe dream, coming up through the black and dreamless slumber to the\nwarmth and security of arms about her and the steady pulsing of an\nimmortal heart in her ear. This time, however, there was the rumble\nof voices speaking congenially about trees and the health of the\nland; one deep and rich and resonating against her ear, the other a\nsofter baritone a short distance away. Both voices were familiar to\nher, but she loved the former so much, it hurt. She stirred,\nreaching up and wrapping her fingers tightly around the collar of a\nsoft suede tunic to convince herself once more that he was really\nthere and not a construct of her imagination.\n\n\"I think she's\nwaking at last,\" Legolas said, his voice lowered, \"and I\nimagine you will want some time alone with her. At dusk I will have\na light supper sent up for her, and a helping from the bounty of our\nhall prepared for you as well.\"\n\n\"Many thanks .\n I will also want a bath eventually, before Elara tells me I stink\nof horse and dusty road or you have me heaved out of your hall as a\nhealth hazard,\" Thranduil replied, and Elara felt his hand leave\nits resting place at her waist to cover her hand where it clung to\nhim and hold it in place gently. \"Where are the baths from\nhere?\"\n\n\"I will have water\nput to heat. You need only speak to one of the servants, and they\nwill direct you to your room and see to your needs. Do you have more\nthan just the two bundles here that I need take to your chamber?\"\n\n\"Nay. I have no\nintentions of attending court or playing King while I'm here, so I\nbrought only as much as I could comfortably carry. My sole concern\nwas to get here before...\" His hand tightened around Elara's.\n\nLegolas' voice held an\nocean of sympathy. \"I understand completely, Father. I shall\nsee you later, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Tomorrow, more\nlikely. It has been a long journey, and I am more fatigued than I\nexpected. I have not been that long on horseback in more than an\nAge.\" Thranduil sounded more than a little chagrined. \"I\nam frankly amazed my legs still work and support me when I stand.\"\n\nLegolas gave a low\nchuckle. \"I shall bid you good day and night, then. May you\nboth find peace in your reunion, for I fear you look almost in as\nmuch need of her company as I know she is of yours, Father.\"\n\n\"You have no\nidea.\" Thranduil's voice thickened from what must have been\nstrong emotions. \"Thank you, my son - for everything.\"\n\nThere was a soft click\nfrom the direction of the door that told her that Legolas had left\nthe room. Thranduil ran a very gentle finger down her cheek.\n\"Welcome back to the waking world. How do you feel?\"\n\n\"As if I had\nlabored all day in the sun,\" Elara admitted with a rueful smile.\n \"But better.\" She breathed in his scent. \"I'm still\nnot entirely sure I'm not dreaming you here, however. How... Why?\"\n\nHis long fingers teased\nback the tendrils of hair that framed her face. \"Aragorn wrote\nto warn me you were becoming quite fragile, and that he could do\nlittle for you. Legolas' message, which arrived the same day, by the\nway, was far more blunt. He told me you were fading quickly now in a\ndespair that had only grown worse in your time here, and that if I\never wanted to see you alive again, I had best make my way to\nIthilien soon.\"\n\nElara wondered that he\nseemed unable to keep from touching her, running his fingers over her\nface over and over again as if memorizing it by touch as well as by\nsight. \"You were supposed come here to heal, my gift, not fade\naway and die,\" he chided her sadly. \"Had I known this was\nthe state you would be in after such a short time here, I would never\nhave allowed you to leave Eryn Lasgalen in the first place.\"\n\n\"We agreed...\"\nshe began, her voice thick with emotions that she dared not voice.\n\n\"Yes, we did,\"\nThranduil admitted. \"However, the fact remains that I sent you\nhere to protect you from that which was making you fade, not to make\nyou fade faster.\"\n\n\"I would have\nfaded in your hall too, Thranduil,\" Elara reminded him gently,\n\"and that was the point. You made me promise...\"\n\n\"Don't speak to me\nof the promises I made us both make,\" he growled and suddenly\npulled her very close into his arms. \"They were cruel and\nextreme, and bitter medicine, even for me. To think I have almost\nkilled you...\" His voice filled with horror.\n\n\"This is not your\ndoing, but mine,\" she shook her head against his shoulder. \"I\nhad no idea that leaving you would be so much worse than staying and\nhaving you out of reach.\" She moved her arms to hold him back a\nlittle and rested her cheek against the dusty suede, choosing to let\ngo of the grief of separation in favor of fully enjoying the fleeting\nmoment of togetherness. Surely it wouldn't last long. \"To\nthink I get one more of our never-to-happen-again moments is a\nmiracle and comfort to me. It will make my last days...\"\n\nHis hold on her\ntightened almost to the point of being painful. \"Speak not of\nthat. You will not fade, my gift. I won't allow it.\"\n\nElara shook her head.\n\"I don't know that I can stop it now,\" she told him gently.\n \"My life has little meaning anymore. I have no reason to\ncontinue and haven't for several years now. Best that I let go;\nperhaps I will find more happiness past the circles of the world. It\nis a comfort that I at least get the opportunity to farewell the one\nI love best.\"\n\n\"This is wrong,\"\nThranduil's voice broke as he loosened his hold on her. \"I\nshould never have set us so far apart, my gift. Obliging us both to\nignore what was in our hearts was to demand a step too far. It did\nnot have to be that way, I know this now. It does not have to be\nthat way any longer. Please...\"\n\n\"Thranduil.\"\nElara reached up a hand and her fingertips ghosted over the soft,\nwarm skin of his cheek. \"My doom was sealed the moment I\nadmitted to myself and you that I had fallen in love with you.\nAlthough I knew better, I would always want that which I would be\ndenied.\" Her arm grew too heavy to hold up, and it fell back\ninto her lap. \"I still know better, and even now find myself\nunable to stop wanting what rightfully belongs to Lalaith.\"\n\n\"Can you not at\nleast try to stay, for me?\" he asked in a small voice, telling\nElara how upset he really was. \"Can we not work together to\nfind a middle ground where I can give you as much as I can and accept\nyour giving me as much as can be allowed, so that you can find some\njoy in life again and remain in this world for your full allotment of\ndays?\"\n\n\"I will always\nwant more than you will be willing to give me,\" she sighed,\nwishing she could make him understand the depth of her pain. \"I\nwill always want  you . That will never change.\"\n\n\"You can have me,\nin all ways save the one that belongs to Lalaith alone,\"\nThranduil insisted, his distress mounting. \"I will no longer\ncompel you to hold your peace about your emotions, nor will I remain\nsilent any longer about mine for you. I will not oblige you to keep\nyour distance or to withhold your touch from me in our private\nmoments together, nor will I withhold mine from you. Please, Elara,\ndo not walk this dark path where I cannot follow. Not yet!\"\n\nElara lay in his arms,\nstunned. \"You're serious,\" she said after a long moment.\n\n\"I am.\" A\nwarm splash of wetness landed on her forehead that told her that her\nElvenking - the proud, capricious, headstrong and arrogant ruler who\nhad determinedly led his Elven Realm to survive Sauron's wrath with\nno help from anyone else - was weeping. \"I give you my oath,\nElara; we can share our love even though we will never share a\npassion that would betray Lalaith. Do not so easily let go of this\nlife, I beg you.\"\n\n\"Thranduil.\"\nHis grief was tearing at her, and her own tears spilled freely onto\nher cheeks. \"I will walk that dark path one day, whether that\nday be tomorrow or many years from now. I am mortal; I  will\nleave you someday. You knew this from the start.\"\n\n\"I know,\" he\ngulped and cradled her cheek with a huge hand that was actually\nshaking as his thumb brushed at her tears. \"But many years from\nnow, if you can but turn back to me, I will have a great share of\nmemories of our time together to hold close and give me as much\ncomfort as is possible to give to one who will miss you until the\nbreaking of the world. But if you leave me now, not only will I miss\nyou forever, but I will know that you left me far too soon, and that\nI am the cause of your death. I don't know...\" His voice\nbroke, and Elara heard him swallow several times before he could\ncontinue. \"I don't know that I would long survive you in that\ncase.\"\n\n\"That isn't fair,\"\nshe complained, her voice wavering. \"You have a realm that\nneeds you strong and well, and alive. You should spend your time and\nenergy on Eryn Lasgalen, not worry about a world-weary mortal woman\nwho can't even see her hand before her own face. Don't make this\nharder for me than...\"\n\n\"Elara, hear me.\nMy son will leave this world when Elessar dies. My wife left me two\nthousand years ago. My father, my brothers, they all left before\nthat. Many whom I called friend either died in the War or left for\nthe Havens with Galadriel. All whom I have loved best, except you\nand Legolas, are beyond my reach; and I am oath-bound to remain\nbehind, no matter what else happens. The Valar gave you to me to\ngive me the strength to hold on as the age of the Elves waned; and to\nteach me how to survive the last of the blows I must bear alone when\nLegolas takes the ship West. I know I have done a poor job of caring\nfor you of late, but I beg one more opportunity to make things\nright.\" Another warm splash from above hit her nose.\n\n\"I don't have the\nenergy to keep the two of us alive,\" she whispered, overwhelmed.\n \"I can't even summon the strength to sit up and be angry with\nyou for trying to shift responsibility for  your  life to  me\nin this way.\"\n\n\"I don't expect\nyou to keep us both alive. I have more than enough strength for the\nboth of us, if only you will try to accept what I'm offering,\"\nThranduil whispered back, his lips against her hair. \"Please,\nmy gift. Be angry with me if you must, but be angry  here , in\n this  world. Let me help you, let me help you get well again.\nTurn away from the path you are treading and come back to the light -\nand me. And once you are well, I will take you home with me where\nyou belong, where your absence has been felt by others and not just\nme.\"\n\nHome to Eryn Lasgalen,\nwhere the trees spoke to her willingly and protected her; where she\nhad first found her place among the Elves. The very idea pulled at\nher heart. \"I would like to go home someday, Thranduil,\"\nshe said very softly.\n\n\"Then we must make\nyou well enough to endure the journey,\" the deep voice stated\nwith emotion-thickened conviction, obviously working hard to find\nstability again. \"I sent word to Gondor about my intentions\njust before leaving for Ithilien. Aragorn should send word very soon\nwith his ideas for aiding in your recovery, or I'll know the reason\nwhy.\"\n\nElara turned her face\ninto his chest and sighed, feeling the weight of her grief fall away\njust a little. \"After all this time...\" she mused aloud,\nclutching at the suede as tightly as she could. \"I have missed\nyou so.\" Her voice broke again.\n\n\"And I have missed\nyou, my gift - desperately.\" His arms folded around her again,\nand he bent his lips to her ear. \"I love you, Elara  n\u00een\n- and I always will, unto the breaking of the world and beyond.\nNever again will you go a day without hearing that, I swear it to\nyou.\"\n\nShe opened her mouth to\nrespond, and then paused - the words caught in her throat. \"I\npromised I would never say it again...\"\n\n\"I release you\nfrom that cruel oath, and everything else that we agreed that night,\"\nThranduil growled into her ear. \"We shall make new oaths, you\nand I, better ones. But Valar forgive me, right now I need to hear\nyou...\"\n\nShe needed no further\nenticement, and the words sprang from her lips. \"I love you\ntoo, Thranduil - and I always will.\"\n\nWith that, the hole in\nher heart - the one that had bled loneliness and sorrow and stolen\nher will to live since the day she'd ridden away from Thranduil's\nhall - closed a bit. There was no promise that she could regain all\nthat she had lost, but in that moment, in her Elvenking's arms, she\nknew she could but try. They both deserved another chance."}

Then the Lord of Mandos gave Maranw\u00eb a grin which the Maia could only describe as 'wicked'. \"Please extend our apologies to His Majesty,\" N\u00e1mo said formally, \"and say that we are not receiving visitors at this time and would he care to return in... oh, eighty years or so.\"  Maranw\u00eb was hard-pressed not to start laughing. \"But he is not asking for admittance for himself, Lord,\" he said, his eyes twinkling with mirth. \"He's imitating his ancestress L\u00fathien.\"  N\u00e1mo raised an eyebrow at that revelation. \"You mean...\"  Maranw\u00eb nodded. \"He's demanding his elf back.\"  N\u00e1mo shook his head, closed his eyes, and uttered a few choice phrases in Valarin that caused Maranw\u00eb's eyebrows to nearly disappear into his hair.  \"We'll see about that,\" N\u00e1mo uttered darkly as he gestured for Maranw\u00eb to precede him down the hallway towards the front gates of Mandos.  Aragorn Elessar Telcontar, High King of Gondor and Arnor, was not amused. He gave the mithril and gold gates of the Halls of Mandos one last pounding and then stopped and stepped back, his posture one of defiance and anger.  \"Damn you, Legolas!\" he fairly screamed. \"You come back here you... you... impossible elf, you!\"  \"Tsk, tsk, Estel. Such language.\"  Aragorn stopped his ranting and felt a frisson of something that was less than fear but more than joy coursing through his body and slowly turned around. Standing behind him was a Being, taller than he. He was dressed in a knee-length tunic of nubbed wool dyed a midnight blue with silver embroidery of harts chasing one another. Under this was a figured silk shirt of pale green, embroidered at the cuffs with an intricate knotwork pattern in silver thread. Over this was a sleeveless robe of forest green brocade that brushed the top of his calf-high black leather boots. The robe was trimmed with red fox fur around the neck, along the open front and hem. The arm openings, which went nearly to his hips were also trimmed with fur. His leggings were unbleached suede leather tucked into the boots. His blue-black hair was long and braided elf-fashion, the gems of his front braids glittering in the light that was everywhere and nowhere. On his head he wore a mithril-wrought coronet with a single pigeon-egg ruby in the center. A mithril-linked pendant of the Sun-in-Eclipse graced his neck and a belt of tooled leather was around his waist, its buckle a twin to the pendant. He was smiling, though that didn't necessarily assure the Mortal standing there with his mouth open. Slowly, Aragorn found himself on his knees before the Lord of Mandos.  \"It's been a while, hasn't it, son?\" N\u00e1mo said genially. \"I think the last time was with W\u00eddfara... or was that the time before?... I forget.\" His smile turned even more wicked than when he'd been speaking to Maranw\u00eb and the Lord of Mandos had the pleasure of seeing the King of Gondor and Arnor start sweating. Which, come to think about it, was a neat trick when said king was here in f\u00eba only.  \"Oh do get up, Estel,\" N\u00e1mo continued with mock impatience, gesturing for the Mortal to rise. \"I really don't have time for all this, you know.\"  \"I've come to...\"  \"I know why you've come, child, and the answer is 'no'.\"  Aragorn blinked. \"Why...\"  \"He died, Estel. Plain and simple,\" N\u00e1mo said, sounding less impatient and more sympathetic. \"He's already passed through Judgment and now sleeps. When he awakens he'll have no memory of his life in Middle-earth, not until he is released from here and is again re-embodied.\"  Aragorn shook his head in disbelief. \"No... it's not been long enough,\" he protested. \"I only just got here. I saw him passing through the gates. I almost caught up with him...\"  \"Estel,\" N\u00e1mo interrupted, reaching out and taking Aragorn into his embrace to offer whatever comfort the Mortal would accept from him. \"It's too late. Time runs differently here than in Middle-earth. Trust me. Legolas is safe and he is no longer in pain. Let him go, child. Return to your proper place and mourn, but know that Legolas is well and will someday be restored to his family and friends.\"  \"Not to all,\" Aragorn insisted as he pulled himself out of N\u00e1mo's embrace, his expression a mixture of grief and anger. \"Not to all,\" he repeated, more softly.  \"No, not to all,\" N\u00e1mo agreed compassionately.  \"And Gimli...\"  \"Ah, yes, Gimli.\"  \"I'll fight you for him,\" Aragorn said suddenly.  N\u00e1mo gave him a disbelieving look. \"Excuse me?\"  Aragorn was now nodding enthusiastically. \"I'll fight you for Legolas' f\u00eba. If I win, we both go back and if I lose, I go back alone.\"  N\u00e1mo found himself intrigued in spite of himself. Truly, these Children were endlessly delightful and full of surprises. \"And if I refuse, what then, Edainion?\"  Aragorn hesitated, now unsure before the implacable gaze of the Lord of Mandos. N\u00e1mo nodded, sure that he had gotten his point across to this admirable Mortal. He could see L\u00fathien gazing back at him through the king's eyes.  \"What contest could you hope to best me in?\" N\u00e1mo then asked mildly. \"I, who am a Vala, one who danced before the Throne of Il\u00favatar.\"  Aragorn frowned, then sighed in resignation, realizing the futility of his challenge, yet unwilling to back down. \"I cannot go back with out him, Lord,\" he pleaded. \"Thranduil...\"  N\u00e1mo's eyes narrowed. \"Yes, Thranduil,\" he said darkly and Aragorn found himself shivering in spite of himself. \"Always a force to be reckoned with,\" N\u00e1mo added. Then, he came to a decision and his visage lightened towards something closer to humor. \"Very well, Isildurchil,\" the Vala said. \"But as you issued the challenge, I get to choose the weapons and the venue.\"  Now Aragorn gave the Vala a wary look but nodded in agreement, silently berating himself for stepping into what he was sure was a trap. N\u00e1mo sent a brief thought to Manw\u00eb and heard the amused laughter of the Elder King in his mind.  We will see that you and he are undisturbed, my brother, came the thought from Ilmarin.  \"Yes,\" N\u00e1mo said almost musingly. \"I will choose the weapons and the field of battle.\"  Aragorn, deciding he had nothing to lose, asked a question. \"May I see him?\"  N\u00e1mo gave the Mortal an indecipherable look. \"Yes, thou mayest,\" he said formally, \"but in this I warn thee: speak to him not, for if thou dost, he will be returned unto my care and thou shalt return unto Life without him, even shouldst thou win against me in our contest.\"  The King of Gondor and Arnor nodded his understanding and acceptance and then suddenly they were no longer before the mithril and gold gates of Mandos but in a grassy arena surrounded by fourteen thrones and Aragorn son of Arathorn felt his very soul shrivel in fear, recognizing where they were.  N\u00e1mo gave him a compassionate look. \"Fear not, child! Thou art not in any danger of Judgment. This is merely a most convenient venue for our little competition. None will disturb us here. The Elder King has decreed it so.\"  Aragorn looked more relieved but his expression was still wary, for he did not know what this contest he had so foolishly demanded of the Lord of Mandos would entail. Then all thoughts of this were driven from his mind as suddenly Legolas was there, standing next to N\u00e1mo, his expression blank.  Almost he spoke his friend's name out loud, but stopped himself in time, remembering N\u00e1mo's admonition. Aragorn noticed that, unlike himself, Legolas stood in naked f\u00eba. Even his locks were bare of their warrior braids with their gems and beads. The dark golden hair hung loose and free nearly to his waist. The King of Men gave the Vala a worried look.  \"What's wrong with him, Lord?\" he asked.  N\u00e1mo smiled, placing an arm around Legolas' shoulders. \"Nothing, child,\" he answered. \"As I told you, Legolas has already undergone Judgment and should be sleeping now. His memories are slowly being... suppressed for a time, that he not be overburdened with memories of pain and guilt. Even now, he has forgotten much about his life, though the process will take some time. I suspect that you will have already left the Circles of Arda before he awakens and joins the other f\u00ebar in the Halls of Waiting where he will spend more time learning innocence once again.\"  \"Will he remember when he goes back with me?\" Aragorn demanded.  N\u00e1mo forced himself not to smile at the choice of words. Aragorn might not know what the contest would entail but he was confident of winning or at least hopeful of doing so for his friend's sake.  \"Yes,\" he replied. \" If  you win,\" stressing the first word, \"all of Legolas' memories will be restored to him. Have no fear on that score. Now, shall we get on with this? You are disrupting my schedule. My secretary is most put out by it as you failed to make a proper appointment.\"  This was said with such blandness that Aragorn was taken aback and was unsure how to respond, though he felt himself reddening with embarrassment. He did not trust himself to speak, only nodding.  \"Let us begin then,\" N\u00e1mo intoned and then the most amazing thing happened.  N\u00e1mo gestured and an oversized board of alternating squares of inlaid obsidian and pearl floated before them. There were figures on the board, half carved from what Aragorn recognized as white opal and the other half from onyx. It was a chessboard.  \"We're playing chess?\" Aragorn asked, realizing even as he spoke how stupid he sounded.  \"A royal game of wits,\" N\u00e1mo said with a nod, \"demanding keen insight and a sound sense of strategy. A worthy contest, think you not?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Good,\" the Vala said with false cheer. \"And to make the contest even more interesting for me, if not for you, I think we should change the stakes a bit.\"  Aragorn gave the Lord of Mandos a wary look. \"What do you mean?\"  Instead of answering right off, N\u00e1mo gestured again and two ornately carved chairs appeared and he indicated that Aragorn should take one. Without thinking about it, he sat in the chair behind the white pieces. N\u00e1mo hid a smile as he took the other chair. Legolas he silently directed to sit between them on a stool. Aragorn was glancing idly at the board as he sat and stifled a gasp, for it seemed to him that as he gazed upon it a mist formed in its center and when it cleared he could see himself kneeling over the body of his dearest friend, while all around him a battle raged.  \"What...\"  \"That is what is happening around you even as you are here seeking for your friend's release,\" N\u00e1mo said gravely. \"Your men and the elves of Ithilien are fighting hard to protect the two of you as you continue working over Legolas. That, however, may not last.\"  Aragorn looked up at N\u00e1mo and saw how the Vala's slate-grey eyes had gone dark, sending a frisson of fear down his spine.  \"So, these are the stakes,\" N\u00e1mo continued solemnly. \"If you win, you and Legolas return to Middle-earth and all is well. If you lose, however...\" Here he paused and the smile that crept across his visage was not pleasant. \"If you lose, I get to keep you both.\"  \"What?\" Aragorn nearly shouted, rising to his feet in shock.  N\u00e1mo nodded. \"If you lose, child, you both die,\" he repeated. \"This game will be for more than just Legolas' f\u00eba, it will be also for yours. If you lose, Eldarion becomes the next King of Gondor and Arnor, somewhat earlier than expected, but...\"  Aragorn sat down heavily, still reeling from shock at the implications of the Vala's words. \"And Arwen...\" he whispered.  \"And Arwen will follow you into death,\" N\u00e1mo said quietly. \"I will grant you this one mercy, son of Arathorn: I will allow you to wait for her to come to you so you may leave the Circles of Arda together.\"  \"What if I choose not to play?\" Aragorn asked, almost afraid of the answer.  N\u00e1mo shrugged. \"Then you go back to Middle-earth alone and Legolas remains here with me.\" He paused for several minutes to allow Aragorn time to assimilate all this before speaking again. \"So what will it be, Estel? Dost thou accept the stakes, or wilt thou return to thy proper sphere without thy friend, yet knowing that he is safe and will return unto Life when the time is mete for him to do so?\"  Aragorn looked up at the Lord of Mandos and N\u00e1mo saw L\u00fathien looking back at him again. Even before the King of Gondor and Arnor spoke, the Vala already knew what answer he would give and was pleased. \"Lord, play thy game.\"  \"As you have chosen white, you should make the first move,\" N\u00e1mo stated, settling back into his chair, curious to see how this would end.  Aragorn nodded and started to reach for his first piece, but N\u00e1mo stayed him with a gesture. \"We will allow Legolas to help us. Merely state your move and Legolas will move the pieces for us.\"  Aragorn gave the elf a sideways look. Legolas did not respond, merely staring straight ahead. Then he looked to N\u00e1mo who merely raised an eyebrow. The Mortal sighed and leaned back with a nod. \"Maethor aran ando canad.\"  Legolas, his eyes still unfocused, reached over and deftly moved the warrior before Aragorn's king forward two squares. N\u00e1mo nodded and stated his own move. \"Maethor aran ando leben.\"  Again, Legolas reached over and moved the stated piece the required number of squares. While Aragorn contemplated his next move, N\u00e1mo addressed him. \"So, just how did you and Legolas come to this?\"  Aragorn gave N\u00e1mo a surprised look. \"But do you not know, Lord?\" he asked in confusion. \"Surely Legolas would have told you.\"  \"Yes,\" N\u00e1mo said with a nod, \"but I'm interested in hearing your version of the events.\"  For a long moment Aragorn did not speak, merely stealing another glance at his friend sitting silently and unaware before returning his attention to the board. \"It was stupid really, what happened.\" He sighed. \"We received word that agents out of Khand were moving through Mordor inciting the former slaves who now live around the Sea of Nurnen to rise up against Gondor. It is not a rich land, but I have done what I can to alleviate their plight and better their lives.\"  N\u00e1mo nodded, well aware of this. \"Go on,\" was his only comment.  Aragorn grimaced. \"The army consisted mostly of Khandian soldiers and malcontents from Harad and Umbar; the rest were the few from the settlements in southern Mordor who had bothered to listen to the agents' diatribes against Gondor and me in particular. I asked Legolas to join me and he came with a contingent of his wood elves. Faramir joined us with his own rangers. I was determined to put the rebellion down as quickly as possible and punish the ringleaders but had no intention of punishing anyone else.\" He gave N\u00e1mo a steady look. \"I still intend to do that howsoever this game ends. Umbar canad,\" Aragorn directed towards Legolas, who then moved the warrior before the king's steward two squares.  N\u00e1mo raised an eyebrow in amusement. \"Maethor vaba umbar canad.\"  Legolas dutifully moved the black warrior and removed Aragorn's piece so that now their two warriors were side-by-side. Aragorn made his next move almost at once. \"Arann\u00fbr calma canad.\"  Before Legolas was finished moving the king's steward diagonally across the board three squares, N\u00e1mo stated his move. \"Bereth ungw\u00eb canad tafnen.\"  Aragorn evinced surprise at the move, giving the Lord of Mandos a measured look that nonetheless gave nothing away as Legolas moved N\u00e1mo's queen diagonally onto the board. N\u00e1mo merely sat there with an amused smile. Now Aragorn concentrated more fully on the board though he already knew what move he would make.  \"Aran umbar min,\" he said and Legolas moved the king one square to the right, thus moving the piece out of check.  \"Parma leben,\" N\u00e1mo then said, almost negligently. Now Aragorn's steward was in danger of capture. \"So what happened?\" the Lord of Mandos asked while Aragorn studied the board and his options.  Aragorn actually reddened in embarrassment and cringed slightly. N\u00e1mo merely placed his left elbow on the armrest and his chin in his left hand, contemplating the Mortal sitting across from him, thoroughly enjoying himself at Aragorn's expense.   You're being naughty,  he heard Vair\u00eb chide him with a laugh.  You know you're going to let the dear child win.    I don't know anything of the sort,  N\u00e1mo shot back with mock affront.  And even if I did, he couldn't help adding, I'm going to make him work for it.   Tulkas offered his own comment.  Tell him that Legolas' death would have been avoided if he'd just kept his mouth shut. That should make him feel even more guilty than he already does.    And what would that accomplish?  N\u00e1mo asked with mild amusement.   Nothing much,  Tulkas admitted and N\u00e1mo could almost see his brother's shrug.  But it would be amusing to see just how red his face can turn.   Now several Valar and a few Maiar started laughing.   I trust you will not let him suffer too much, my lord,  N\u00e1mo heard Ol\u00f3rin say.  He is a good Man and worthy of our respect.   N\u00e1mo smiled, though Aragorn did not see it.  If I did not have as much respect for him as I do, Ol\u00f3rin, I would not be wasting my time playing this game. I would have simply handed Legolas over to him. Accepting his challenge was my way of honoring him and Legolas. Such devotion between these two friends should not go unrewarded. Legolas never blamed Aragorn for what happened, however embarrassing it was for them both.   There were nods all around and more than one Vala and Maia looked in on the game with interest.  \"Arann\u00fbr vaba parma leben,\" Aragorn said, unaware of the silent conversation going on around him. He shifted his position a bit and made himself more comfortable. \"What happened is that I killed my friend,\" he stated baldly.  His tone was such that N\u00e1mo, who was about to utter his next move, stopped and gave him a considering look. \"Legolas never blamed you,\" he said quietly. \"If anything, he blamed himself.\"  Aragorn gave him a disbelieving look. \"How could he blame himself? I'm the one who...\" He scowled and looked upon his unseeing friend with great sorrow and regret. N\u00e1mo could see how much the Mortal wished to apologize to Legolas but remembering the strictures of the game forbore to speak, biting his lips.  \"Rochben umbar eneg,\" N\u00e1mo said quietly and Legolas reached over to move the king's horseman out onto the board. \"Tell me why you think you killed your friend.\"  For a moment Aragorn merely stared at the board, then he took up his tale again. \"In spite of the fact that it's nearly Yule, I decided to take the war to the Khandians rather than wait for them to attack. My spies had informed me that the rebel army was planning to take the southern pass in the Ephel D\u00faath through which the River Poros flows. They meant to cross the ford and attack South Ithilien. I intended to meet them in the pass and stop them before they reached the ford...\"   It was snowing in the pass, for the mountains, as far south as they were, were high enough. There was little shelter, though a stand of evergreen trees did give them some relief from the wind. The elves stood around on guard, seemingly unaffected by the weather, while Aragorn, Faramir and their men all huddled in their cloaks. Aragorn was beginning to regret his decision to meet the invaders in the pass. As strategies went, this was not one of his brightest and he was glad his brothers were not there to point out all the flaws in his plans.   \" I'm glad Gimli isn't here,\" Legolas said suddenly with a smile, as if he had been reading the king's mind.   \" Oh?\" was all Aragorn could manage.    The elven Prince nodded, his smile widening. \"He'll be too busy telling us all how daft we are to be of any use when the enemy attacks.\"    Aragorn found himself grinning in spite of himself, thankful for Legolas' bit of levity. \"This is a stupid idea...\"   \" Nay, Aragorn,\" Legolas said, his mien becoming more solemn. \"It is best we end this now before it escalates into something more than a few hundred malcontents wishing to make trouble.\"    Aragorn nodded and was about to comment, when one of Legolas' scouts came silently across the snowfield, leaving no trace. \"They come,\" he said and at a wordless signal the Men and Elves readied themselves for battle...   \"Calma vaba parma leben,\" N\u00e1mo said.  Aragorn stopped his narrative to give the board a glance as Legolas removed his steward taken by one of N\u00e1mo's warriors. They had continued playing even as he had told his story and now N\u00e1mo had just captured his steward. In spite of the fact that several of his warriors were on the board, leaving his king somewhat exposed, Aragorn felt confident that the king was ably protected by the tower that now stood beside it. With one move he could hem in N\u00e1mo's queen even more than it already was. The Lord of Mandos, he realized, had made a mistake in releasing his queen into play so soon without first seeking to control the center.  \"Ungw\u00eb canad,\" Aragorn said, thus instructing Legolas to move a warrior forward, so as to threaten N\u00e1mo's queen.  N\u00e1mo moved his queen back another square out of danger, but Aragorn pressed the attack and moved the same warrior forward another square. Again, N\u00e1mo moved the queen forward one square. It was the only safe place for her. Taking Aragorn's warrior would not have worked in the long run. At that point Aragorn decided it was time to play his own queen.  \"Bereth umbar neled,\" he instructed Legolas and the silent elf complied.  \"Rochen anga toloth,\" N\u00e1mo said, thus sending his horseman back to its original position.  \"Arann\u00fbr vaba umbar canad,\" Aragorn declared almost before Legolas had time to follow N\u00e1mo's instructions.  Legolas moved Aragorn's remaining steward, removing the warrior protecting N\u00e1mo's queen, leaving her vulnerable. It did not take N\u00e1mo long to make a decision and he told Legolas to move his queen one square on the diagonal back towards the queen's own square. Aragorn sat contemplating the board.  \"So you were saying?\" N\u00e1mo asked, attempting to prod the Mortal to continue his tale.  \"We held the pass itself,\" Aragorn responded, \"for we had gotten there before them. We had the advantage of ground, but the weather made that problematic...\"   Aragorn, Legolas and Faramir moved out of the protection of the trees and climbed towards the top of the pass. The snow had not let up and the wind was now swirling it round, making seeing difficult, even for the elves, though they would not have admitted it to these Mortals, Aragorn knew. Eyesight might have been hindered, but not hearing.   \" They're coming up along both sides of the path itself,\" Legolas said quietly to Aragorn. \"I do not know why the path itself is being ignored.\"    It did not take them long to discover the reason. Dark shapes began to form just below them, struggling along either side of the actual path leading into the pass and on the path between them...   \" Valar!\" Faramir exclaimed softly. \"Are they insane or just stupid?\"    That, of course, was a very good question, as far as Aragorn was concerned. The Khandians were hauling a massive block of wood that was obviously meant to be used to break down the gates of Minas Anor. It was something like Grond, Aragorn mused, though smaller. It was strapped to a wooden frame on runners and was being pulled by ropes.   \" Did your people see any scouts?\" Aragorn asked both Legolas and Faramir and they both shook their heads.   \" We wondered about that,\" Faramir answered. \"We could not understand why the pass wasn't being checked to see if it were clear. Now we know why.\"   \" Their arrogance and stupidity will be their downfall,\" Aragorn said with a nod. He was about to   issue his first order when a horrendous screech rent the air above them. It had been forty or so years since any had heard that terrifying sound and they all ducked instinctively.   \" Nazg\u00fbl!\" someone nearby screamed.   \" Nay!\" Legolas shouted above the sound of terror, \"for they are no more, but it is one of their fell winged creatures.\"    Then out of the swirling snow a terrible monster flew towards them and they all began to scatter. Aragorn suddenly realized why the Khandians had not bothered with any scouts. As they were running towards the stand of trees and shrubs that huddled off the path some hundred yards further down the mountain, Aragorn looked back and he felt his blood freeze with horror.   \" Legolas! Watch out!,\" he screamed...   \"Bereth vaba tinco min tefnen,\" N\u00e1mo said calmly, interrupting Aragorn's narrative with the capture of a tower, putting Aragorn's king in check for the second time.  The King of Gondor and Arnor took a deep breath and studied the board more carefully to make sure he hadn't made any mistake in strategy.   He's a very good player,  Manw\u00eb said to N\u00e1mo as they watched the Mortal consider his next move,  and an able strategist.   N\u00e1mo agreed silently.  He believes that what happened next was totally his fault and his flawed thinking led to the disaster which followed.    I hope you will teach him otherwise, brother,  Tulkas said.   Not I,  N\u00e1mo countered.  Legolas.    Ah...  Orom\u00eb said, his voice full of approval.  A good strategy, brother.   N\u00e1mo smiled to himself. I  learned from the best,  he said, bowing mentally to Orom\u00eb and Tulkas, both of whom chuckled.  \"Aran ando t\u00e2d,\" Aragorn said.  N\u00e1mo nodded. \"Arann\u00fbr vaba anga min.\"  Legolas moved Aragorn's king diagonally to Aragorn's left, then brought N\u00e1mo's steward down to capture Aragorn's other tower. So far, N\u00e1mo had captured five of Aragorn's pieces, including both towers and a steward, greatly diminishing the Mortal's strength. Nineteen moves into the game, Aragorn had only managed to capture two of N\u00e1mo's pieces, both lowly warriors. Other than the queen, Aragorn's only power pieces were the two horsemen and the remaining steward.  \"Ando leben,\" Aragorn finally said and now a warrior stood between his two horsemen.  \"Rochben tinco min.\" N\u00e1mo made his move and the horseman that had yet to be played was moved out.  \"Rochben vab' anga odog tafnen.\" Now Aragorn was on the move, capturing another warrior with his own horseman and putting N\u00e1mo's king in check for the first time.  \"Aran quess\u00eb toloth,\" N\u00e1mo decided, moving his king one square to his right. \"So now we are getting to the end of your tale, I think,\" he said, giving Aragorn a wry grin, well aware what had happened.  Aragorn reddened slightly and sighed. \"I turned around and saw that Legolas had stopped to shoot at the winged monster bearing down upon us. I shouted for him to watch out...\"   At Aragorn's shout, Legolas started, his arrow missing its mark, though it did hit the creature, just not where it would have done the most damage. Then to Aragorn's horror, the elf, in attempting to avoid the beast's gaping jaws, appeared to trip backwards over something unseen in the snow and start rolling down the mountainside, gathering speed.   \" Legolas!\" he screamed again, trying to reach his friend while avoiding the flying horror at the same time. All around him elves and men were attempting to bring down the creature even as the Khandians were reaching the peak of the pass and preparing to join the fight. Aragorn ran after Legolas who was still careening down the mountainside at a fast clip, tumbling head over heels. Then the elf hit a snowbank and went up into the air, twisting a bit before falling into a stand of trees and shrubs.    Aragorn heard a strangled scream coming from the holt and ran as quickly as he could through the snow, finally reaching the place where his friend had landed. He stopped in horror when he saw that Legolas had impaled himself on a broken tree branch. From the way the tree in question was rocking back and forth, it appeared not to be any happier about the situation than the elf hanging there. He was looking down at the offending branch with a peculiar expression on his face. Then Legolas glanced up at Aragorn.   \" Valar!\" he whispered in surprise, \"That hurts!\" ...   N\u00e1mo fought hard not to laugh at Aragorn's expression of embarrassment in relating the ignoble manner of his friend's death. \"Let me get this straight,\" he said with a much calm as if he were discussing the state of the weather on Taniquetil, \"a wood-elf skewers himself on a... tree?\"  Aragorn glanced at Legolas who still sat there with his blank stare and nodded. \"And it's all my fault.\"  \"Probably,\" N\u00e1mo said with great equanimity. \"Your move, by the way.\"  Aragorn sighed, rubbed his hand across his face and pinched the bridge of his nose before taking another look at the board. His confession of being the chief cause of his friend's death had not relieved him of his sense of guilt and remorse and he wondered if he would ever be able to forgive himself. A moot point, he thought, if he did not win this game. He took a long hard look at all his options and then he saw it. He gave the Lord of Mandos a surreptitious glance then lowered his eyes back to the board, schooling his features to imitate stone. N\u00e1mo watched with faint amusement.   He's figured it out, hasn't he?  Varda asked, sounding both amused and please.   Yes,  N\u00e1mo said, feeling equally pleased,  he has.   \"Bereth umbar eneg tefnen,\" Aragorn said, then practically held his breath as Legolas moved his queen in position to check N\u00e1mo's king a second time.  The Lord of Mandos made a show of examining the board with as much care as Aragorn had just done, all the while continuing the conversation with his fellow Valar.   How do you intend to... er... heal Legolas of his wound?  Irmo asked out of professional curiosity.  It was, after all, quite fatal. The only one who doesn't seem to accept that is the Mortal sitting across from you. Even Legolas allowed that it was an accident and that nothing could have saved him.    I was hoping you or Est\u00eb might have some suggestions about that,  N\u00e1mo said even as he gave Legolas his instructions. \"Rochben vaba umbar eneg.\"  Legolas dutifully reached over and moved the horseman so as to take Aragorn's queen.   Already working on it, brother,  Irmo replied.  Aragorn stared at the Lord of Mandos for the longest time before stating his final move, never taking his eyes off N\u00e1mo. \"Arann\u00fbr and' odog... aran gwann.\"  Silence reigned across the M\u00e1hanaxar for several minutes and then Aragorn heard clapping, faint at first, but slowly getting louder. He looked about and slowly rose in awe as he realized that thirteen of the thrones that ringed the area were occupied and their occupants were the ones applauding. The King of Gondor and Arnor, of the blood of L\u00fathien and Beren, E\u00e4rendil and Elwing, swayed in shock and N\u00e1mo was quickly at his side.  \"Be at peace, child,\" he whispered encouragingly as the applause faded along with the Valar themselves, \"all is well. Time to return to your proper sphere.\"  Aragorn looked up at N\u00e1mo. \"Legolas...\"  \"When you return to Middle-earth you will deal with what you find there. As I promised, Legolas will be returned to you.\"  Aragorn looked over at his friend sitting calmly and unaware, his expression becoming one of grief. \"He's dead, isn't he?\" he asked. \"Truly dead. The wound... I knew it was fatal and I could see in his eyes that he knew it as well, but I couldn't accept it. Even as I struggled to save him, I knew it was hopeless.\" He stopped, tears running down his cheeks. \"I looked into his eyes and it was as if I were back on Amon Hen and it was Boromir dying...\"  \"Hush now, child,\" N\u00e1mo chided Aragorn gently. \"You cannot save him, but I promise he will be healed, but only if you go back now. Look you.\" He pointed towards the chessboard and a mist seemed to gather above it and then clear, revealing the same battle scene Aragorn had seen earlier but now he saw that Faramir and several other Rangers had managed to bring the flying creature down while the elves were still ranged around their fallen prince and the king.  \"Time to go back, Estel,\" N\u00e1mo repeated. \"Time to return to your people.\"  Before Aragorn could protest he felt his f\u00eba being drawn away back into his mortal frame. \"Legolas!\" he screamed even as the vision of his friend standing next to the Lord of Mandos faded from his eyes and he found himself back in Middle-earth looking down on the bloody body of the elven prince. All around was chaos as his troops continued to fight the Khandians. Thankfully, the snow had ceased to fall while he had been... elsewhere and the wind had died as well. Indeed, the sun was even now peeking out from behind clouds that were beginning to break apart.  Aragorn continued to kneel before his friend wondering at the fact that what had felt like hours while he had played chess with the Lord of Mandos had only taken a few short minutes. In spite of everything, Aragorn could tell from the sound of Faramir issuing orders that the Gondorian army had the upper hand and was even now overwhelming the rebel army. It didn't matter, though. All that mattered was Legolas lying lifeless in the snow. He wondered if the Lord of Mandos would truly release the elven prince and how ever would he heal him of his most fatal wound.  Even as these thoughts ran through his mind, above the sounds of battle, he heard the jingling of harness bells and the neigh of an approaching horse. Aragorn looked up to see the wood elves who were still guarding him and Legolas open up a space, their expressions ones of awe. The D\u00fanadan found himself rising in awe as well.  \"Glorfindel?\" he asked in disbelief.  And so it was. There was Asfaloth, gleaming whiter than the snow. Upon him sat the elf-lord dressed, somewhat incongruously, in an ankle-length hooded robe of deep scarlet trimmed with white rabbit fur. Beneath this he wore a surcoat slit for riding that was a deep forest green brocade with a diaper pattern of stars and scallop shells. His leggings were suede dyed a dark yellow and tucked into black leather boots. The shirt that showed at the neck and wrists was of white lawn embroidered in an intricate knotwork pattern of greens and gold. When the elf pulled down his hood they could see he was wearing a wreath of ivy, holly and winterberries.  Glorfindel smiled down at the Mortal. \"Greetings, Estel. I see I've arrived just in time.\"  \"In time? In time for what?\" Aragorn exclaimed. \"He's dead, Glorfindel. I tried to save him. I thought I had saved him, but...\"  \"Tush, child,\" the elf-lord said as he dismounted from his steed and went to embrace the king. \"All is not lost.\"  \"Why are you here, Glorfindel?\" Aragorn asked. \"How did you get here in the first place? You should be in Imladris.\"  \"And so I was, but I had a... feeling that I was needed here so I left Imladris two weeks ago.\"  \"Two weeks! You covered the distance between Imladris and here in two weeks?\" Aragorn stared at his friend and mentor in awe and noticed that some of the wood elves were doing the same.  \"Actually I made it to Minas Anor in ten days,\" Glorfindel corrected with a smile. \"But, let us not concern ourselves with that. Legolas needs attention.\" Saying that, he knelt beside the still body of the elven prince, and shook his head in amazement, taking in the evidence of the cause of Legolas' death even as he examined the elven prince's body. \"How is it that a wood elf allows himself to be skewered on a tree branch?\"  \"I'm sure Legolas didn't set out to do it on purpose,\" Aragorn muttered in frustration.  Glorfindel gave the Mortal a brilliant smile and then reached into an inner pocket of his robe and pulled out a mithril bound leather flask, handing it to Aragorn. \"When I tell you, give this to Legolas to drink.\"  \"But...\"  Glorfindel shook his head, then laid his hands on the open wound, closing his eyes. Quietly he began to Sing and the hairs on Aragorn's head rose in shock at the Power behind the Song. All went still as the elf-lord continued Singing. Then, as Aragorn watched, it seemed to him that Others were there. There was nothing to see, but he felt Them and they seemed to be lending their own Power to the elf-lord kneeling beside him.  The Song continued to grow and then Aragorn gasped as he saw the gaping wound begin to close of itself. As Glorfindel's Song came to a final triumphant note, they saw Legolas' body arch and then he started breathing again, though he did not regain consciousness.  \"Now, Estel,\" Glorfindel commanded.  Aragorn belatedly remembered the flask in his hands and swiftly unstopping it, raised Legolas' head as he pressed the flask to his blue lips and had the pleasure of seeing the still unconscious elf swallow.  \"All of it,\" Glorfindel said and Aragorn continued to administer the drink to his friend until the flask was empty.  As he laid Legolas back down, the wounded elf's eyes fluttered open. He seemed to focus on Aragorn and Glorfindel, recognized them and smiled before falling back to sleep. Only then did Aragorn sense the Others fading, though not before feeling the brush of a hand on his brow in benediction. Glorfindel began to remove his scarlet robe.  \"Let's get him wrapped in this,\" he said.  \"Nice coat, by the way,\" Aragorn said as he helped Glorfindel bundle Legolas into it.  Glorfindel gave him a knowing smile. \"Arwen seemed to have had her own prescient moment, for she pushed this on me just as I was about to leave Minas Anor, saying it would come in handy.\" He gave a merry laugh. \"I think it's meant to be your Yule gift.\"  Aragorn gave the elf-lord a shocked look, then grinned at the thought. Soon he was laughing as well. Faramir approached just then to report that the survivors among the Khandian army had surrendered.  \"None of our people were seriously hurt,\" Faramir concluded, glancing down at the still sleeping elf. \"At least almost none,\" he amended.  Glorfindel and Aragorn nodded. Then the D\u00fanadan gave Glorfindel a deep bow of gratitude. \"Thank you, mellon n\u00een. Thank you for Legolas' life.\"  \"The pleasure was all mine, Estel,\" Glorfindel smiled warmly, holding Aragorn's face between his hands and kissing him on the brow.  \"So what's with the wreath?\" Aragorn then asked, giving the elf a questioning look.  \"Why, Estel, it's Yule!\" Glorfindel exclaimed laughingly. \"Should I not wear something festive for the occasion?\" Then before anyone could reply to that, the Reborn elf-lord began singing a joyous hymn to Elbereth. Soon all the elves and the Gondorians joined in and everyone was glad."}

The birds were chirping, the bees buzzing in the heather. A lovely breeze caressed the new blooms in the garden. It was his favorite kind of day!  Glorfindel poked his head out of the door, glanced left and right, smiled wickedly and slipped out into the hall. With the stealth of a warrior who has eluded Morgoth's spawn for centuries beyond mortal recall, he evaded any and all who might seek to waylay his steps and mission.  Ahead he could see freedom \u2014 the door leading outside away from the drudgery of duty, paperwork, council meetings and  him.    Just another twenty paces and he would make it.  Ten.  Five.  He opened the door, with a sigh of relief and\u2014  \"Glorfindel, where are you going? The reports are not turned in, the duty rosters are not filled out and Elrond would like a word with you. Do not even  think  to escape this house until you have spoken with  him .\"  Turning with controlled grace, Glorfindel eyed the one who had caught him so close to victory. \"Lord Councilor,\" he acknowledged with a nod to his dark-haired, stern-looking nemesis standing not a stone's throw from him.  Too far away to impale with his sword. He cursed inwardly.  \"What is that smirk for? Or do I wish to know your thoughts?\" Erestor raised a brow.  With a shake of his head, Glorfindel banished any desire to murder Elrond's chief councilor. After all, it was not Erestor's fault Elrond needed to see him.  He closed the door and felt his shoulders sag with disappointment, but could not bring himself to draw them back to their proud places. Gloomily, he walked beside Erestor towards their lord's study, his steps slowing any time they passed a window.  \"Oh, by the shadows, Glorfindel! Do not sulk! You knew this would happen!\"  With a sheepish shrug, he glanced at his friend. \"Yes, I knew, but Erestor, I do not wish to do this! Not today, not with  him!\"   He did not miss the slight upwards quirk of Erestor's lips or the gleam in his companion's eye. Glorfindel glared back.  \"My advice is to get it over with,\" Erestor said, as if he were not trying to fight back the laughter which Glorfindel could see shaking his shoulders.  \"How do you stand it, Erestor? I will have to endure an hour or two at the most with him, but you\u2026you must spend all day with him!\" Feeling his breathing quicken, he stopped for a moment to steel himself, leaning against the closest wall.  A snort caused him to open eyelids he was not aware of closing.  \"It is not so bad, really. And it is only at this time of the year. It will pass, and he will return to his solemn and dignified self. In the meantime\u2026\" Erestor dug in his left pocket, frowned, and then reached for the right. \"Aha!\" With a grin, he pulled out a handkerchief and handed it to Glorfindel. \"Your weapon, Captain.\"  \"Oh, you can not be serious!\" But he took the offensive cloth, holding it away from his body between his forefinger and thumb.  \"You look like a maiden when you hold it like that.\"  Glorfindel stuffed his only defense into a pocket of his tunic. Reaching up, he pinched the bridge of his nose in hope of relieving the imminent headache beginning to pound behind his temples. He inhaled deeply, then dropped his hand to his side. \"All right, let us continue. I believe I am prepared now.\"  They refrained from any further speech as they wound their way through the halls of the Last Homely House, coming to a stop outside a large, ornate door. It contained many carved representations from the books of lore the owner of the door was so fond of. Glorfindel always enjoyed looking at the beauty of the rich wood so expertly detailed with scenes he himself remembered.  But this day, he only cast a longing look at a panel which depicted himself fighting the balrog. Oh, those were the days! Open battle, sword ringing! Not\u2014  He patted the pocket containing the square of folded white linen, and knocked on the door.  From within came a sneeze, followed by a muffled, \"Cuhm eh,\" and the sound of someone blowing their nose. He grimaced, but pushed open the door anyway.  \"Lord Elrond, you wished to see me?\"  \"Ah, yeth, Glowfinnel. Cuhm eh, cuhm eh. We ned to dithcuth the doo-ey rothter.\" Another sneeze, then a sniff, and one more honk of the Peredhel's nose. \"Haf a theat.\"  With resigned obedience, Glorfindel crossed the room and sat in the chair facing the desk, behind which his lord sat. He tried to angle himself away from the line of sneezing, but with Elrond, one never knew. He reassured himself one more time of the handkerchief in his pocket after noticing the open windows letting in the fresh spring air.  \"Don fwown at me. Leth juth geth thith ovah wid.\"  \"Sorry, my lord.\"  Oh how Glorfindel used to  love S pring!  Spring was a time of renewal \u2014 a return of all things green and the warmth of the sun. With dismay, Glorfindel noticed the fine layer of yellowish-green dust on Elrond's desk. Plastering a false smile on his face, inwardly he screamed. Why did the Peredhel insist on keeping his windows open at this time of the year? Why did he not just remove the offensive trees planted all around the Last Homely House?  He knew why, of course. Celebr\u00edan had loved the flowering fruit trees and planted them near the house not long before she\u2014  Glorfindel pulled his thoughts from that course. He understood why Elrond left the trees in, even after it became apparent they caused the lord to suffer miserably in the spring. It had not been until Celebr\u00edan had sailed that the pollen became such a nuisance.  Not even Elrond understood what caused some people to be so affected by pollen, though mortals were far more susceptible to have allergies. Perhaps Elrond's mortal blood was the reason the lord suffered more than any elf in the valley. Glorfindel did not know.  What he did know was that Celebr\u00edan would never have wanted her husband to suffer such agony for her beautiful trees. Had she still been here, she would have requested they be moved to a better location, away from the house. But no matter how many times Glorfindel told Elrond that holly would be just as lovely, with the dark leaves and red berries, and would  not  cause the allergies Elrond suffered, Elrond had refused to remove the fruit trees.   Ahhhchooo!   \"Sowwy.\"  With all the dignity he could muster, Glorfindel pulled the handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his face of the offensive droplets of moisture.  And it had started out such a beautiful day.  \u2014  o \u2014   The door closed behind him with a thump, and Glorfindel sagged against the nearest wall, dropping his head into his hands. Two and a half hours! That was how long it had taken them to communicate with Elrond's sneezing and honking. He squeezed his eyes closed and bit back the roar of frustration he would like to let loose.  He needed to get out of the house and outdoors. Find a stream to bathe in to remove the lingering saliva and other bodily fluids he would rather not consider from his face.  \"Surely it was not  that  bad?\"  The voice caused him to look up with a glower. \"You knew it would be, or you would never have given me the handkerchief!\" He threw the offensive cloth towards Erestor, but the councilor let it drift to the floor.  They both eyed the linen, until a passing maid stooped and added it to her basket of dirty laundry. She continued on her way, mumbling under her breath about the untidiness of males. Both Erestor and he smiled at the deprecations coming from the slight girl.  \"Can I assume you will now seek solace in the outdoors? You look as if you could use a ride.\"  Glorfindel straightened with a grin, his frustration falling from him with thoughts of getting outside. \"Yes. That is exactly what I plan to do.\" He passed Erestor, who was pulling a clean handkerchief from a pocket and heading towards Elrond's door. \"How many of those do you have, anyway?\"  Erestor just shrugged. \"At this time of the year? A dozen at least.\" With determined steps, Elrond's Chief Councilor disappeared into the study.  Glorfindel made his way to the nearest doorway leading outside, his long strides eating up the distance to the stable, where he was greeted with a friendly nicker. He rubbed the soft, white nose reaching for him over the stall door.  \"Ready for a run, my friend?\"  Asfaloth bobbed his head up and down, snorting in Glorfindel's face. \"Not you too!\" he complained, wiping his face on his sleeve, but this time he grinned. For some reason, horse snot was not as offensive as Elrond's had been.  Opening the stall door, he let the stallion out of the confines of the stall. He left the horse's tack on the rack nearby. Saddles and headstalls he only used when traveling long distances, which required having something to tie his pack to other than his own back. The headstall was more for decoration, anyway, and since he had no plans to impress anyone, except perhaps some fish when he bathed, there was no need for it.  Leaping upon Asfaloth's back once they were outside, Glorfindel gave the command. \"Noro lim!\" And they were off quick as a flash, the hooves clattering over the ground as the horse's strides took them off into the valley and away from the Last Homely House and her moody, sneezing lord.  For over an hour they rode into the wilds. Glorfindel gave Asfaloth his head, and the horse set his own pace, slowing from his wild dash after a short distance and into a comfortable canter that ate up the miles. He needed little direction, for the horse knew where his master wished to go, and he paced beside a winding stream, following it on its course.  In due time, they arrived in a small meadow surrounded by a thicket of birches. Here, the babbling brook widened into a deep pond where a colony of beavers had dammed the flow of water. With a single word, he brought his mount to a halt. For a few minutes, Glorfindel just sat atop Asfaloth and took in the beauty of the scene before him.  The meadow grasses were green and not yet overly tall. Mixed with them were wildflowers of purple, yellow and red, decorating the field like a random carpet with occasional pockets of heather and broken by a couple of burrows and a few rocks.  A hare grazed amid the grasses, sitting up to look at him a moment, before seeming to deem him harmless and hopping on to a new patch of clover. One of the beavers was swimming towards the dam, a tree limb firmly wedged in its strong teeth. In the thicket across the pond, came the sound of another chewing relentlessly away on another bole.  Glorfindel slid from Asfaloth's back and quickly divested himself of boots and clothing. He twirled, arms outstretched, and threw back his head, drinking in the sunlight warming his naked skin.  Asfaloth whinnied and wheeled on his back feet, darting across the meadow, bucking and kicking up his heels. Glorfindel's laughter echoed back to him, filling the glade with merriment. Then he took off running and dove into the still water, causing hardly a ripple as he dipped into its shining surface.  Though spring had visited them once more, and Arien soared overhead, the water retained some of its winter chill, and Glorfindel did not linger in it overlong. The fish would have to wait for a warmer day to be further impressed. He climbed up onto a rock, which made up part of the dam, and allowed the breeze and sun to dry his skin.  Asfaloth trotted along the edge of the pond, stopping to paw at the water playfully from time to time. Glorfindel wondered if his horse could see the small fish darting beneath its surface. When Asfaloth lowered his head and pressed his nose under, moving it quickly about, Glorfindel laughed aloud. Indeed, it appeared the young stallion had discovered the fish. The horse brought his muzzle out of the water, neighing plaintively before casting confused eyes in his master's direction.  Shaking his head and getting to his feet, Glorfindel made his way back to where he had discarded his clothing. While getting dressed, he tried to ignore his pathetic beast so intent on catching the minnows and fingerling trout.  Asfaloth could not seem to accept that the fish were not toys meant for horses and continued to submerge his nose only to come up snorting and whickering, until the breeze picked up. Whirling so fast, Glorfindel jumped, the horse took off across the meadow, his belly flashing in the sunlight as he twisted and reared.  It was so good to see a young horse play, Glorfindel thought. Asfaloth's sire, Faerlain, had died over the winter, and Glorfindel, who had raised the old stallion from a newborn foal, missed the old horse terribly. For the Elves whose lives were as long as Arda herself, the brief lives of mortals, even horses, were too fleeting. How many times had he wished his steeds could be like Nahar, the mount of Lord Orom\u00eb, who died not? Too many to count, if he stopped to think about it.  Elven-bred horses were little different from horses raised by Men, except as far as their life span went. On average, elven horses lived to the age of fifty or even sixty as Faerlain had proven. Whereas the horses of Men rarely lived to see thirty or forty.  The elves found it easier to train their steeds, having a closer bond to the animals than mere Men, and Glorfindel could understand Asfaloth's manner of speech as well as the stallion understood him. Few surpassed the elvish steeds in speed or endurance, except perhaps those which belonged to the bands of Men the elves had heard now roamed the plains to the south. It was rumored the newcomers had a line that lived much longer than the average horse. What had the messenger from Lothl\u00f3rien said they were called?  Mearas ?  Yes, that was it.  A bump to Glorfindel's back brought him out of his thoughts and back to the meadow. A head draped over his shoulder and he absently reached up to scratch behind the ears. He hoped he had many years with this delightful creature. And after this spring, Asfaloth's own foals would join them, and in time, perhaps one of the stallion's descendants would bear the same name, if he proved to be worthy of it.  With a sigh and a last glance at the peaceful meadow dressed for Spring, Glorfindel mounted and urged Asfaloth to head back home.  The track back took longer as both he and his horse wished to linger, in no rush to return to stall or house. Detouring down a gentle embankment, Glorfindel let Asfaloth pick his way carefully down to an ancient riverbed, now a dry bed of stones. They followed it at a walk for a time, until rounding a bend. Glorfindel gasped, and then grinned.  About a hundred feet ahead of them stood a copse of holly trees, and scattered among them were many saplings.  It only took him a few minutes to shed his outer tunic and wet it in a small gurgling spring he found further into the grove. Using his knife, he quickly filled his tunic with young holly trees, and bundled them up in his tunic with enough soil to keep them happy until he could put them in the care of those who kept the grounds of the Last Homely House.  This was the last year he would put up with a sneezing, grumpy Elrond! He would see to it, even if Elrond would not, and if the elf lord argued, Glorfindel would do the unforgiveable and tell his lord that Celebr\u00edan would not wish him to suffer so.  Guilt often accomplished what reason would not.  Asfaloth returned them home in good time, and Glorfindel delivered his package to the head gardener, to much amusement to all who saw what he bore. With a smile, Erech\u00edl agreed to work his namesake holly into the landscape gradually, and to find other plants and trees that would not cause the lord of the house such pains. It would take time \u2014 many years even \u2014 but eventually, Spring could be a happy time once more, free of handkerchiefs!   To Be Continued...

Neither she nor her younger brother and sister had eaten anything decent for the last two days, and they all would begin to feel it if the day's pickings weren't good enough to find something better than the half-spoiled tossings from the trash heaps on Fourth Circle.  She idly scratched at the red bump where the pests in her bed had feasted on her the night before, and then swiped a hand beneath her nose with a wet sniff before shifting slightly to keep herself in the darkness behind a pillar. Ivoreth knew she was small enough to fit herself into most of the shadows and remain invisible to the crowd while she chose the best target for her day's work.  Once every seven days she had this chance, and she'd learned the hard way long ago not to call attention to herself or allow anything to get in the way of what needed doing. The din of haggling voices, the flapping of drying clothes from clotheslines strung high overhead, the occasional barking of stray dogs, the smell of meat slowly turning sour in the sun, the ever-present hum of gnats, the ringing of the bell up in the Citadel that called the hours, the itch of insect bites \u2013 she'd learned to block it all out while watching for the careless food vender to look the other way at the just the right moment.  But today her caution was even more important, because today she needed to do more than simply filch a loaf of bread or a fistful of berries \u2013 today she needed to come by coin as well. Her three year old sister had developed a nasty cough and a low fever, and the local apothecary had little time for any without the means to pay for her services. And so she ignored the many details that sought to drag her attention away from the people in front of her. Her gaze flitted from a housewife with a babe settled on a tipped hip to a trio of plainly dressed servants obviously buying for their lord's larder. Plenty of pouches with coin were just waiting the touch of her light fingers that day. Which one would be the best one to tackle?  Who they were didn't matter. All that mattered was that each of them had that which she needed \u2013 and she was out to change that. Need was driving her now \u2013 a need to provide for and protect her own.  Ivoreth carefully studied and mapped out in her mind the narrow walkways between the booths and outspread blankets piled with goods for sale that was market day in Minas Tirith. Combined with the scaffolding and bustling workmen repairing the damage, there would be a good chance of escaping the square itself, should she be spotted; and she needed to be familiar with all the routes open to her and any obstacles she could hand to any giving chase.  She also quickly located landmarks that indicated the most direct route to the back alleys and child-sized hiding holes of the lower circles of the White City that had become her home since the King had returned. Her brother and sister were safe in the place she'd made for them deep in the maze-like storm drain within the thick outer walls of the city. The bars and barriers along that channel were meant to keep the Enemy out, not children; and many Guards and angry victims had been eluded over the past two years by ducking into one of the openings.  Ivoreth's gaze darted from one side of the scene to the other, counting the number of Guards present and noting their various levels of alertness. The Guards, like the shoppers, grew less wary as the welcome spring sun moved over the Minas Tirith market square; but they remained a real danger to her. Getting nabbed by a Guard meant being tossed into one of the new orphanages the Queen had set up throughout the city, or even into prison.  However, she remembered her Da's tales of being treated like a slave after getting caught himself and tossed into one of those holes by the then-Lord Denethor's justices. The mistress of that particular orphanage had earned herself extra coin by selling her charges into a craftsman's fostering far earlier than allowed by law \u2013 and the tales of the beatings and abuse he'd received from the smithy he'd been sold to had given her nightmares when very young. She was determined not to let that be her fate or that of either her brother or sister. A full belly, Da had said to her not long before he'd died in the siege of the city, wasn't worth the ill treatment.  There! Not far away from where three half-grown boys cheered and ran after a rawhide ball, a portly woman bartered with a hefty-looking pouch hanging casually at the back of her hip angrily with a seller of fish. Ivoreth had used the diversion of street urchins' games as a cover before for simple stealing, and she knew her chances this time of getting close to someone paying no attention to her coin pouch would never get better.  Cautiously she pulled the slender knife \u2013 the last gift her Da had given her \u2013 from its worn sheath on her rope belt and tucked it up against her wrist. It wouldn't do to cut anybody else by accident \u2013 or chance it being knocked out of her hand before she'd had a chance to cut the pouch strings. Ivoreth pasted a smile on her face and walked out into the bright sunlight as if she belonged. She put herself in the path of the playful boys, and then laughed and ran with them as if she were part of their game. Every few moments, she would glance at her target to make certain the woman was still paying attention only to the fish seller \u2013 and every few moments, she found herself a little bit closer. At last she was close enough \u2013 and began to reach out the hand with its concealed blade.  A huge metal-studded paw wrapped itself painfully around her wrist, stopping her action before anything had happened. The force of the grip numbed her hand, and the little knife fell to the cobblestone of the market square. \"Just what do you think you're doing?\" a rough voice demanded.  Ivoreth cried out in pain as she was hauled back hard against a metal-clad body by an armored arm about her throat, her empty knife hand twisted behind her and pulled up nearly to her shoulder blades.   Where did they come from? I thought I'd seen them all\u2026   \"I think we got us a thief,\" another voice replied triumphantly.  Ivoreth's eyes watered as she squinted up into the sunlight to peer at the helmeted face towering over her, and she shivered at the sight of the calculating coldness in the eyes of a second Guard before her who held up her Da's knife. \"I didn't do nuthin'\u2026\" she whined, squirming to try to ease the tension on her arm. The one that held her arm behind her jerked her hand even further upward, nearly pulling her arm from its socket. \"I didn't do nuthin! Lemme go!\" she screamed again, this time in real pain.  \"Not because you didn't try, girl, so shut it!\" A heavy hand cuffed the side of her face, staggering her. \"You don't want all these people to be witnesses against you, do you?\"  Ivoreth gazed about her wildly. A few of the shoppers were glancing curiously in her direction, but their gazes didn't linger before looking away again. Of course the looks on the faces of the Guards would scare anybody into looking away.  The Guard in front of her bent down and peered at her, then licked his lips. \"You know what they do to thieves?\" He asked softly, with a leer that made her blood run cold.  Ivoreth swallowed hard, but glared out at him. \"I ain't no thief.\"  \"Of course not,\" he said in a tone of voice that told her that he  knew  otherwise. \"But it sure looks like you were going to cut somebody's pouch strings with this here little blade.\" He waved her Da's knife in front of her eyes again. \"A person doesn't run around with something like this in hand without meaning to do somewhat of a mischief.\" He bent down close enough that the sour smell of wine made Ivoreth's stomach turn over. \"Now answer my question \u2013 what does the King do with thieves?\"  \"Prison?\" she squeaked in terror.  Da said he'd heard they don't even feed a person there!   The second Guard's laugh made her shudder. \"Aye, for a night or two \u2013 but only until they set you against the dungeon wall and put an arrow through you. You ain't worth the coin to keep longer than that.\"  Ivoreth began squirming again, despite the agony in her arm.   Raini! Daren! Who will feed you now? Who will keep you safe?   \"Please\u2026\" She gazed back and forth between the Guards as she tried to slip from the unforgiving hold. \"I didn't mean it\u2026 I promise\u2026\"  The Guard who held her arm let go of her throat and gave her a shove forward that he controlled with her twisted arm. \"Oh sure! Now you're all innocence and promises. But that little knife of yours tells a different story. They may even put that arrow in you tonight for that.\"  Ivoreth sobbed in dread. This was worse than her Da had told her \u2013 to die like this, over so very little!  \"Indeed,\" the second Guard agreed all too quickly. \"Who's to say that you weren't going to shove that blade into that poor woman?\"  \"I wouldn't\u2026\" she protested, beginning to understand that her words meant nothing to these men.  \"Yeah? Who's gonna believe a gutter-snipe like you?\" the first Guard snarled, pushing Ivoreth into a narrow lane between buildings, back away from the crowds.  Ivoreth blinked in confusion. This wasn't the way to the prison  or  the orphanage! \"What are you going to do? Where are you taking me?\" Her pitch climbed as her horror doubled.  \"She's a bit young,\" the first Guard said in a low voice.  \"I like 'em like that,\" the second replied, giving Ivoreth a leer that made her stumble in terror and disgust. \"Why shouldn't we enjoy ourselves before taking her in? It'd be a real shame to waste this one by letting her die unspoiled.\"  The first Guard's reply rang like a death knell. \"Aw \u2013 why bother taking her in at all when we're done? She's just like the others \u2013 nobody will miss her.\"  Ivoreth began to struggle in earnest. She'd seen other girls being dragged away by pairs of Guards into the deepest shadows before; she'd heard their screams echoing through the night even into the depths of the storm drain \u2013 and seen what was left of them in the morning's cold light. But never in her darkest nightmares had she ever thought that she'd end up as one of them. \"Let me go!\" she screamed, deliberately ignoring the agony of her twisted arm and shoulder to kick backwards towards the leg of her captor.  \"She's got fire,\" the second Guard commented, then thrust his face into hers. \"Scream all you want now, little girl \u2013 we're gonna make you scream anyway.\"  Ivoreth managed to duck and slip away just enough so that she could turn and take the pressure from her abused arm. She screamed again wordlessly and sprang at her captor, grabbing at his helmet and trying to rip at his face with her teeth.  \"Sauron's balls!\" the first Guard yelped. From behind her came the clutch of violent hands at both shoulders, and Ivoreth was torn away from her captor. Pain exploded within her head as her nose and face slammed into the stone of a nearby wall, and she heard the tearing of cloth as she fell into a bottomless pool of darkness and knew no more.  oOoOo  Reality returned to Ivoreth gradually, the intense pain slowly began to overwhelm her senses.   I'm not dead yet?   Her nose and cheeks felt as if they were on fire, she couldn't seem to open her eyes, nor could she move her right arm. From the depths of the darkness that still surrounded her, she tried to scream her pain, fear and desperation \u2013 but all that emerged from her lips was a low moan.  \"Get those animals out of here!\" A rough man's voice ordered sharply from several paces away, the harsh sound of it making Ivoreth flinch violently and then moan in renewed agony \u2013 but it wasn't the voice of either of the men who had caught her.  \"She's a thief and a murderess,\" shouted the first Guard. \"We were only doing our duty!\"  \"What you two were intending to do to this child most certainly was  not  your duty \u2013 even if she were the things you say! You bring shame to your office \u2013 and to yourselves.\" the rough-voiced man replied angrily. \"If you'd gotten any further, the lord there would have been within his rights to run you through.\" Sounds of scuffling and cursing gradually faded away into the distance.   Are they gone? I need to get up \u2013 I need\u2026 Get away\u2026 Before someone else comes\u2026   In an attempt to calm herself and think of a next action, Ivoreth breathed in through her nose; and then she coughed as the air dragged with it a choking, coppery liquid. The cough was pure agony, and she moaned again.  Ivoreth felt a soft cloth wrap over and around her, and only then did she realize that she was naked. Very careful arms picked her up from where she lay and cradled her close. \"Easy, child. You're safe now.\" A deep and musical voice sounded very close to Ivoreth's ear. She turned her head slightly and then whimpered when the agony exploded anew as she brushed her cheek against the chest of the one who held her now.   Who is this? What has happened to me? Why can't I open my eyes? Why can't I move my arm? Let me go!   \"Hush now,\" the musical voice soothed into her ear. \"All will be well, little one.\"  Ivoreth could tell she was being carried forth \u2013 but to where? And would she be imprisoned once there \u2013 leaving Raini and Daren to starve or to be caught and thrown into an orphanage and then sold as her Da had been?   Daren doesn't know how to steal things without getting caught \u2013 I didn't want him to have to do that. And Raini's getting sick too often now on the bad food from the trash heaps. What am I going to do? They're going to die just like Evien did!   She shuddered in fear and despair, and then moaned as the tremors only brought forth sharp, new aches and pains to join those already tormenting her. The steps taken grew faster, longer \u2013 more hurried.  \"Merciful Powers, my lord!\" A woman's voice sounded this time as the movement that surrounded her came to a sudden halt. \"Bring her in here \u2013 and let me call\u2026\"  \"I can care for her myself,\" the musical voice announced with calm patience. \"Prepare a draught of poppy juice \u2013 and then a warm bath.\"  Ivoreth felt herself carried a few more steps and then very gently deposited on something soft and comfortable. The soft cloth was removed and another cover brought over her body before she had much of a chance to feel a chill. She heard the sound of water, and then a cool rag was laid very carefully over her aching nose, eyes and cheeks and another was then used to wipe over her mouth and at her forehead.  \"Listen to me, little one.\" The musical voice had moved close to her ear once more. \"Your eyes are swollen shut \u2013 and this is why you cannot see. Your nose is broken. But to care for you properly, we need to know all that is amiss. Do you hurt anywhere else?\"  Ivoreth swallowed hard. \"A\u2026arm,\" she finally managed.  \"This one?\" Gentle fingers touched her right shoulder. The soft touch was another bolt of agony. Ivoreth whimpered and tried to squirm away, only to cry out from the pain of even that small movement.  \"Here is the draught, my lord \u2013 and the bath is nearly prepared.\"  Strong arms slipped carefully behind Ivoreth's shoulders and lifted. \"Drink this, little one. It will help you sleep so that we might tend you without hurting you.\" A tiny cup was put to her lips, and Ivoreth gagged on the first, bitter sip.  She pressed her lips tightly together and shook her head.   No! I can't sleep! I need to get back to Raini and Daren! Let me go!   She would have struggled, but her body still wasn't paying attention to what she was asking of it. Just trying to move made her shoulder explode again, and she whimpered her pain.  \"Yes, I know it tastes horrid,\" the musical voice seemed to sympathize even as the small cup was returned to Ivoreth's lips. \"But you need this. Finish now.\"  Slowly, sip by sip, Ivoreth choked and gagged the bitter draught down, grateful at last to be returned to her comfortable cushion when it was gone. A tear eased its way past swollen lids to drip down the side of her face and into her ear.   What will they do when I don't come back?   A large hand picked up her left hand and cradled it comfortingly \u2013 and this time, when the darkness came for her, it was warm and welcoming. And terrifying."}

He had already confessed his crime and had heard words of forgiveness from the only person whose opinion mattered anymore, though he did not truly believe them. Still...  One more thing to do...  He tried to reach for his sword, but his strength was failing too fast for him. Then he felt the hilt of the blade in his hand. Now, just this last thing... He looked up into those grey-blue eyes, full of compassion and sorrow and... pride? In him? No matter...  \"I would have followed you my brother,\" he gasped. \"My captain... m-my king...\"  There. He had said it. \"My king.\" Now he could rest...  \"Be at peace, son of Gondor,\" Aragorn whispered, but Boromir son of Denethor, Captain-General of Gondor and the Heir to the Steward's throne did not hear those final words of farewell, nor feel the king's kiss upon his forehead...  0-0-0-0   I failed... I failed.   It was the only thing he could think of in this place, wherever he was.  He looked about disinterestedly. It was a hall, though no hall he ever remembered visiting, it's walls covered with bright tapestries in which the figures seemed to move, or perhaps it was just the wind, though he could not feel any breeze. Banners hung from the beams above, and somewhere there was light, though he could not tell from where it was coming. It was also empty, except for him. And there seemed to be no end to it.  He wasn't sure how he had gotten there \u2014 one minute looking up into Aragorn's eyes, the next... here.  No matter... He had failed, and now he would pay.  \"Are you so sure of that, my son?\"  Boromir turned with a gasp, reaching for a sword that was no longer there. \"Who... who...?\" He found himself face to face with one who appeared to be a Man, tall and lithe, his dark hair long and flowing like an elf's, his eyes grey as those of the Sea Kings of old. He wore a plain black velvet tunic trimmed with black pearls under which there was a shirt of grey watered silk. A thin band of wrought mithril graced his head. But this was no Man, of that Boromir was sure. The light in his eyes spoke of another, older lineage... older even than that of the elves.  The stranger smiled. \"I am a friend, Boromir,\" he said gently, \"nothing more. You have no need to fear. Come, tell me why you think you have failed.\" He motioned towards two ornately carved high-backed chairs facing one another that Boromir was sure had not been there earlier. After a moment's hesitation he followed the stranger and they both sat \u2014 Boromir somewhat reluctantly.  \"Who are you?\" Boromir hissed with barely concealed anger, though he was beginning to guess, and his guesses frightened him. The recent events were beginning to catch up with him and he was suddenly feeling light-headed. He wondered, with the detachment of one who is ill and doesn't care, if anyone had ever thrown up on one of the Powers before.  As if his thoughts had been spoken aloud, the stranger smiled sympathetically, then reached out and gently placed a hand upon the warrior's forehead. Immediately, Boromir felt calmer and the sense of disorientation left him, though not the questions.  \"I will answer your questions, son of Gondor,\" the other said with an amused look as he leaned back into his chair. \"All of them, to the best of my ability. But you have not yet answered  my  question.\"  Boromir looked down, gathering his thoughts, feeling shame spreading through him again as he thought back. \"I betrayed my oath,\" he finally said, speaking softly. Then he looked up, and repeated more firmly, \"I betrayed my oath to the Ringbearer. I deserved death and more.\"  The other nodded. \"Perhaps.\" Then he fell silent and for a long time neither spoke. Somewhere in the distance Boromir thought he heard singing, though the words were indistinct and even the music was so faint he was never sure he was actually hearing anything. Slowly the music faded, leaving the two of them again in silence.  \"Now it's your turn,\" Boromir said with a quirk, a sly grin spreading across his face.  The stranger stared at him for a moment before smiling in return. \"Have you not guessed, child?\"  \"I think you are one of the Powers, perhaps a Maia.\"  \"I am N\u00e1mo, Lord of Mandos and Doomsman of Arda.\" The timber of the Vala's voice deepened and a tremor ran through the hall. Boromir felt something that was less than fear but more than joy pierce his soul and suddenly found himself kneeling before the Vala, though he had no conscious memory of doing so.  \"Forgive me, Lord,\" he stammered. \"I did not mean to ... to\u2014\". Actually he wasn't sure what he did not mean to do, but felt that he should be sorry for it anyway.  N\u00e1mo leaned down and grabbed Boromir's arms, raising him up until they were both standing. Boromir suddenly realized that the Vala was actually laughing.  \"There is nothing to forgive, my son. Your manner is most refreshing. And I am not the one to whom you should kneel. Sit now, and be comforted.\"  Boromir nodded and resumed his seat, but N\u00e1mo remained standing, looking down on him, his eyes bright with amusement.  \"Tell me what you think might have happened if you had not, as you say, betrayed your oath. What would have happened to the Fellowship if you had remained true?\"  Boromir hesitated, unsure where this was going. What would have happened if he had not followed the Ringbearer away from the camp at Parth Galen?  \"We would have been together when the orcs attacked,\" he said slowly, marshalling his thoughts. \"There would not have been the confusion\u2014\"  N\u00e1mo shook his head, interrupting. \"No, not all would have been there in the camp.\"  Boromir looked up, nodding. \"Frodo. Frodo would have been alone.\"  \"Alone. Yes.\" The Vala's expression grew grim.  \"But he was alone when they came anyway,\" Boromir said in confusion.  \"Alone, but not visible.\"  Boromir felt his breath catch at that. Could it be? Could his actions in forcing Frodo to put on the Ring when he did have saved the Halfling's life?  \"Had Frodo not been invisible, he would have been captured before any of you knew of it and then you would all have died there at Parth Galen.\"  Boromir bristled and stood up, forcing the Vala to take a step or two back. \"How can you say that?\"  N\u00e1mo merely gazed at the Man, a faint smile on his face. \"I say it because it is true, or would be if things had gone otherwise.\" He placed his hands on the Man's shoulders. \"Boromir, think. If the Uruk-hai had fallen upon you all without warning, do you think any of you would have survived? It was the fact that you were all scattered about Amon Hen that saved you. The orcs were too many.\"  \"I wasn't saved,\" Boromir said grimly, sitting back down. \"Neither were Merry and Pippin.\"  \"Merry and Pippin are where they need to be,\" N\u00e1mo said, resuming his own seat. \"You need not worry for them. Their road will be harsh and they will not escape unscathed, for it is after all war, but they will do well and each will fulfill his destiny as he must, even as you did.\"  Boromir gave the other man a sharp look. \"I? Fulfilled my destiny? How? By being a traitor and would-be murderer?\"  \"No, Boromir,\" the man said softly. \"By giving Frodo the courage to leave the Fellowship before it was completely destroyed.\"  \"Courage?\" he asked in disbelief. \"What courage could I give him that he did not already possess himself?\"  \"Your actions forced Frodo to face facts and to deal with them, something he was reluctant to do. Without you he would not have done what needed to be done and all would have been lost. You call yourself a traitor and would-be murderer, and perhaps there is some justification, but it was the Ring working on you, not your true nature. That became apparent when you risked yourself in defense of Merry and Pippin, even unto death.\"  \"For all the good it did.\"  The other man laughed softly. \"You little realize just how much good it will do, mellon n\u00een.\"  \"But I failed to save them.\" Boromir protested.  The Vala nodded. \"True, but that isn't what you were supposed to do anyway. Merry and Pippin were meant to be captured by the Uruk-hai, just as Frodo and Sam were meant to travel to Mordor alone, and you...\" Here he sighed, shaking his head ruefully.  \"I was meant to die.\" Boromir said softly, not looking up. He felt, rather than saw, the other lean over and place a hand on his arm. Looking up he saw nothing but compassion in the Vala's face.  \"Faramir should have gone to Imladris in my stead as he was meant to,\" Boromir finally said. \"He wouldn't have \u2014\"  \"Had Faramir gone in your stead, Boromir, your brother would not have done half as well as you did.\"  \"What?\" Boromir leaped up again, ready to defend his little brother even without a sword.  \"Peace, mellon n\u00een,\" the Vala raised a hand, but whether in command or in supplication, Boromir was not sure. \"I speak only truth. Faramir is a worthy son of Gondor and he has an important role yet to play in this game, but he was not the best choice for joining the Fellowship. Frodo needed  you,  Boromir, at the time when that need was the greatest. Faramir could not have done what you did. But never fear, your brother's quality will shine forth before too long and he will be able to serve the Ringbearer in his own fashion when Frodo most needs his aid.\"  Boromir sat back down, unconvinced, but unable to marshal any contrary argument. He loved his little brother and grieved that their father did not appreciate Faramir's qualities. He did not regret that Faramir, and not he, would become the next Steward of Gondor after Denethor. There seemed to be a rightness to that that he could not readily explain, even to himself. Still...  \"Would it help to know that Frodo has forgiven you, knowing that it was the Ring working through you, not you yourself?\"  \"I did not understand,\" Boromir said, almost to himself. \"I did not see. All I wanted was to save Gondor, to save my people. I... I was afraid.\" With that admission he felt tears welling and suddenly he was weeping and found he couldn't stop. N\u00e1mo made no move, but sat there in sympathetic silence, allowing the Man time to compose himself.  \"Frodo forgave you, Boromir,\" N\u00e1mo finally said, speaking softly, as one would to a distraught child. \"And Aragorn. Can you not find it in you to forgive yourself?\"  Boromir shrugged noncommittally, then stopped, caught up in a memory. He looked up at the Vala, his expression uncertain. \"W-when I looked into Aragorn's eyes\u2014\" he stopped, not sure how to continue.  \"Go on,\" the Lord of Mandos said encouraging.  \"I saw something there that I did not expect to see.\"  \"And what was that?\"  \"H-he was proud of me. I could see it in his eyes,\" Boromir said wondering. \"Why would he be proud of me?\"  \"Can you not guess?\"  Boromir shook his head, feeling much as he had as a child when his tutor asked him a question that stumped or confused him.  N\u00e1mo leaned forward, his expression intent. \"You were the first to swear fealty to him as your king. Aragorn will ever treasure that memory, even if he never succeeds to the throne. With your words you gave him hope.\"  Hope. Boromir breathed deeply, suddenly feeling the tension he had not known was there dissipating, and he felt more hopeful himself, unaware that he was smiling. N\u00e1mo nodded, as if he saw the answer to a question in that smile, and stood. Boromir found himself standing as well.  \"We have a saying among the Valar,\" N\u00e1mo said, with a conspiratorial wink. \"'Il\u00favatar draws straight with crooked lines'\".  Boromir shook his head. \"I'm not sure what you mean by that, my lord.\"  The Vala smiled. \"No matter. I'm sure you'll figure it out eventually.\"  Silence came between them and for a long moment Boromir wondered what else there was to say.  \"What happens now, lord?\" he finally asked, not without some trepidation.  N\u00e1mo shook his head. \"That is entirely up to you, my son. You may leave through that door there,\" pointing towards one end of the hall to a door that Boromir was sure had not been there before. \"Or you may remain here until you are ready to move on.\"  \"Remain here?\"  N\u00e1mo nodded. \"Others will come through here on their way past the Circles of Arda. Some you will know, others will be complete strangers. Speak to them if you desire, or not. It does not matter. When you are ready to continue your journey this door will be there for you.\"  Boromir nodded, deep in thought. Then an errant thought struck him and he couldn't resist one last question.  \"So, do you do this with everyone, my lord?\" he asked teasingly.  N\u00e1mo laughed, shaking his head. \"Only with the more troublesome cases, impudent child.\"  Boromir blushed in embarrassment. \"Sorry,\" he whispered, as if he were indeed a child caught in some mischief by an elder.  N\u00e1mo looked upon this Child of Il\u00favatar and smiled more deeply than before and the light in the hall seemed to brighten. He took Boromir's head in his hands and, gazing into his eyes, whispered, \"Be at peace, son of Gondor,\" then gently kissed him on the forehead.  Boromir found himself alone.  For long moments that could have been years he stood there, not moving. Then he slowly sat, vaguely aware that the other chair was no longer there. He wondered if he should leave the hall after all, but something held him in his seat, and a decision formed within him.  He would wait and eventually the one for whom he waited would come. Soon or late, it mattered not. When the time came for Aragorn to take the final road and come into this hall, he would find at least one liegeman waiting for his king.  His king...  His...  And suddenly Boromir son of Denethor, one-time Captain-General of Gondor and Heir to the Steward's throne, began to laugh, and the joy of it echoed throughout Mandos, even unto Il\u00favatar's Timeless Halls."}

Of shoes and ships and sealing wax, of cabbages and kings.\"  - Lewis Carroll,  The Walrus and the Carpenter   l   September 20, 1421. Shire Reckoning.    The last pages are for you, Sam.   But why? What could he add to the memoirs of the Ring-bearer? The Ring-bearers, he should say. Mr. Bilbo had begun it \u2013 properly, that is \u2013 this record of the Shire and its folk, and the Ring and the Travelers and all the lords and ladies and the Elves. What could he add to that?   The last pages . . .   Already the book was nearly done before him. Bilbo's spidery script had given way to Frodo's firm hand, and now that too was ended, and the parchment caught on the rough edges of his fingers as he grasped the quill. There was dirt under his fingernails. He tried to clean them, scraping the underside of his nails one against the other, but the quill shaft bent and a drop of ink fell onto the open page. \"Stupid!\" he cried, and reached to blot it with his paper, but it seeped away into the textured page, a black stain that smeared under his fingers.  With an oath Sam stabbed the quill into the inkpot and stood up, scraping his chair back over the wooden floor. He couldn't do this. Mr. Frodo should have known that, should have known that he would botch it, and why should he do it anyway? Frodo could complete it. He nearly had already, and it wanted just a little finishing up, to make it proper like, and Frodo could do that when he returned from Rivendell. When he returned. The stained page blurred before him, and Sam turned away, rubbing the sudden tears from his eyes.   The last . . .   This was wrong. His breath came short and fast as his throat tightened. This was  wrong,  and he had to get out. He fled the cluttered study, the piled books and maps and parchment. It was Mr. Frodo's study, not his. Mr. Bilbo had intended it to be Frodo's. Not Sam's. Never Sam's. Whatever Frodo might say, Bag End was  his . The Red Book was his. He would finish it, when he returned. And he would return. He would.  Sam hurried through the familiar hall to the entranceway. He pulled the green door open and burst out onto the step. There he stopped and stood for a long moment, breathing deeply. Gradually the constriction of his chest eased. The autumn roses were in bloom, and their sweet fragrance mixed with the fresh scent of cut hay from the fields and the smoky tang of the leaf burnings.  He looked out, over the garden that was fading now as autumn crept on, past the low mounds of New Row with the grass waving high around the chimneys, towards the fields that sloped away to the edge of the woods, riotous in hues of gold and red.   The last . . .   His breath hitched in his chest, and he clenched his hands. A rider was coming up the long road from the wood. He could make out the white horse as it trotted easily along the smooth path, the flash of gold as the sun gleamed on the rider's hair. Though he could not see at this distance, he knew that the horse moved at the command of the rider's voice and touch, unencumbered by saddle or bridle. And he knew that the rider could see him, far more clearly.  Tea , he thought distantly.  I must put the kettle on. And there'll be biscuits in the tin; Rosie made some yesterday. I should have them with honey and apples from the orchard .  But he stood still, and watched as the horse and rider crossed the bridge, passed the new mill and turned up the path to Bag End Under Hill.  I should get Rosie from the Gaffer's; she and Elanor ought not to miss this. And Master Merry, and Pippin as well.   A small group of Hobbit lads and lasses were following the rider, he saw now, but they ducked away and hid shyly when the Elf turned to speak to them.  Frodo will be so happy. He'll want to say goodbye .  But he cut that thought short. His body was numb, and his heart pounded in his ears.   The last . . .   He could hear the steady clop of the horse's hooves now, crisp in the autumn air. It had been a dry summer, and the road was firm and level. The rider came 'round the final curve and stopped before the gate. He swung lightly from the stallion's back and patted his neck, seeming to speak to him. The horse nickered and began to crop the grass along the side of the road.  The Elf leaped over the gate and came up the path, stopping just far enough away so that Sam didn't have to crane his neck to look up at him. It was a long moment before Sam could speak. \"You've come,\" he said.  Legolas smiled. \"It is the last, Master Samwise,\" he said. \"I could do no less.\"  l   June 26, 1419. Minas Tirith, Gondor.   It was spring in Minas Tirith. Sam walked slowly from the small house that had been given to the Fellowship, up through the marketplace in the sixth circle. Morning birds sang in the eaves of the houses and market stalls packed closely along the winding cobbled street. The richest of Gondor's nobility lived here, and their fine houses were now mended, the devastation of the War only hinted at in patchwork seams of new stone that stood out starkly white in the pale light of dawn.  Those in the lower circles were not so lucky, Sam knew. Many of the houses there still had gaping holes in roof and walls, for they had borne the worst of the siege. But spring had come, and with it warm weather for working in fields and quarries. Again and again he had heard it, in the weeks since the War ended: \"The King will rebuild the gates and all the houses \u2013 he's bringing Dwarves, you know, a Dwarf for every house!\" \"The King signed a treaty with the Corsairs: we'll have fresh fish every week; and thirty pieces of gold for every household.\" \"The King is planting the Pelennor with seed he got from the Elves. Come harvest, we won't have storage enough for it all!\"  Sam didn't know if Strider had done any of these things, but it really didn't matter. He was confident that Aragorn  could  do them all, and more besides. Sam firmly believed that the Ranger turned King was the wisest and most noble person in Middle-earth, save perhaps for the Lady Galadriel, and for Mr. Frodo. And the people of Gondor seemed to share his opinion. Elessar had given them hope. For now, that was enough.  But it did little for the immediate needs of the people. The War together with a long winter had depleted Gondor's supplies, and aid from Rohan and the Elves and Dwarves could not come fast enough. The narrow street was crowded with early-rising maids and servants of the rich houses, together with folk from the lower circles, but they milled about with empty baskets, and Sam could hear discontented grumblings as he passed. He had hoped to get a young chicken and perhaps some mushrooms for Frodo's breakfast. But the merchants' counters were nearly bare, and though Sam stood on tiptoe to see over the butcher's block, the pullets were thin and stringy with hardly enough meat to satisfy a Man's appetite, let alone a household with four Hobbits.  Disappointed, Sam continued up the street toward the citadel. He would have to borrow a bit from the King's stores again. He was on friendly terms with the head kitchener: a huge Man with a red face and a pleasant habit of pressing generous shares of whatever might be in the making \u2013 leg of lamb, sweet potatoes, after dinner cakes, rolls \u2013 upon his visitors to take home. Sam had tried to thank him, but the Man seemed surprised by this and had bowed low. \"Anything for one of the Walkers, Master Samwise,\" he had said, which made Sam blush.  There  were  certain advantages to fame, he admitted to himself, as the guards at the courtyard entrance bowed and stood back to let him enter. And it was a fool who left windblown apples on the ground to rot, as the Gaffer said.  All the same, Sam would be glad when the time came for them to return to the Shire. Frodo had been pale and shaky these past few weeks, and to Sam's mind all the healers in Gondor could not compare with a good night's sleep at home in Bag End. Also there was the vision he had seen in the Lady's mirror: of the Gaffer turned out of Bagshot Row, and the trees along the byway cut down. Those things might not have happened, as the Lady had said, but then again they  might  have, and there was only one way to find out. And aside from all of that, Merry and Pippin seemed to be getting far too much enjoyment from their new status as \"Lords of the Halflings,\" something that Sam was certain was not good for them.  He was halfway to the citadel when he saw something that made him pause. The ancient, withered tree was gone. Sam had first noticed it after Strider's coronation, a dead hulk that seemed out of place in the smooth lawn and carefully trimmed hedges of the palace courtyard. Now it was gone, and there was a small white sapling in its place. Someone was kneeling next to it, silhouetted in the early morning light.   Curiosity killed the cat,  his Gaffer would say, but Sam couldn't help taking a closer look. He crossed the lawn, his bare feet marking the dew-silvered grass. Hobbit-silent by nature, Sam made no noise that he could hear, but the figure by the tree turned at his approach, and he saw that it was Legolas.  Sam hesitated, not wishing to disturb him. But the Elf smiled at him, and emboldened by this Sam came slowly forward. He stopped near the steps leading up to the tree and surreptitiously rubbed one foot behind his other calf, trying to wipe the damp grass and earth from his toes.  \"Good morning, Master Samwise,\" Legolas said. \"You are up early.\"  Sam shrugged, a bit shyly. \"A body gets used to it,\" he said. \"I was always the first one up at home, to get breakfast ready and the like. And, begging your pardon, but it seems I'm not the only one.\"  Legolas smiled, his eyes twinkling. \"A hazard of our current living situation, I fear. I thought it best to escape before Gimli's snores brought the house down on top of us.\"  That surprised a laugh from Sam, and he covered his mouth with his hand. He wasn't quite sure what to make of the strange friendship that the Elf and Dwarf had developed. It seemed that they were constantly sniping at each other, yet if anyone else criticized one of them the other would immediately leap to his defense. He had asked Strider about it at one of the banquets after the coronation, and the Man had shrugged and said that he didn't understand it either, but it was best to just let them have at it and try to stay out of the way. King \u00c9omer, who was sitting nearby, had heartily seconded this opinion.  Legolas sobered. Looking back at the small tree, he said softly, \"In any case I would not have slept last night. This is the first, Master Samwise, and I would bear witness to it.\"  \"The first?\" Sam frowned, looking from the Elf to the sapling in puzzlement.  Legolas ran his long fingers through the soft earth around the tree's roots. \"It is the beginning of the end,\" he murmured, his eyes distant, as though he were looking beyond the sapling, at something that Sam could not see. \"Or rather, the beginning was when the Fellowship left Imladris, or perhaps before that, when Bilbo took the Ring, or when Gollum found It. But this is the first. It is the first sign that the dominion of Men is at hand, and the time of the Elves is over. The Elven Rings are fading, and the Third Age of Middle-earth is coming to an end.\"  \"Oh.\" Sam hesitated. \"I thought it was a tree.\"  Legolas laughed, seeming to come back to himself. \"It is that as well, Master Samwise. A scion of Telperion, the Eldest of Trees. Aragorn brought it here yesterday, and we planted it before the dawn.\"  Sam blinked, not entirely sure how to respond to that. \"Well, that's good then,\" he said finally. \"I had wondered, I mean, why they kept that old one here. Dead and all, it didn't seem fitting for a King's garden. Or a steward's, I guess it was.\"  Legolas watched him with eyebrows raised, a faint smile playing over his lips. \"I suppose,\" he said after a moment, \"that many customs of Men and Elves must seem strange to other folk. Gimli has told me as much on frequent occasion.\"  \"Oh, no,\" Sam said hurriedly, \"that is, not Elves, I mean. I wouldn't know nothing about them, begging your pardon, and I wouldn't put myself forward-like to judge them. But Big Folk, you know, are . . . well, different than we're used to. Not in a bad way,\" he added, for Legolas had tilted his head, regarding him quizzically. \"But it's like Strider, carrying that broken sword around with him. I figure it was symbolic and all, but it didn't seem real practical.\"  Legolas laughed, a sound bright as sunlight sparkling on water. \"No, that was not very practical. Truly I tried to tell him as much, over the years, but he can be impossibly stubborn. Granted that Lord Elrond gave him the Shards of Narsil as his birthright upon coming of age, but  why  he felt he had to carry them with him everywhere after that . . .\"  Sam could not help laughing as well. The knot in his stomach relaxed, and without thinking much about it he sat down on the steps of the White Tree's dais. He watched curiously while Legolas continued to work the earth about the tree roots and the rising sun stretched their shadows out over the courtyard lawn.  He debated with himself, working up the courage to ask \u2013  and likely make a mess of it too, botherin' an Elf. You never open your mouth, Samwise Gamgee, 'cept to put your foot in it \u2013  but finally he could stay silent no longer. \"What are you doing?\"  Legolas did not look up. \"I am aerating the soil, Master Gardener. It is heavy with loam and ancient earth from the old tree's bed. The first cannot dwell only in the dark shadows of the past.\"  \"Oh.\" How was it, Sam thought, that when you asked a simple question of an Elf you always ended up with a lot more questions than you had to begin with? He cast about for something intelligent to say. \"Do you want a trowel? I think I've got one, back in the house.\"  Legolas shook his head. \"Thank you, Master Samwise. I am nearly finished.\" He sat back on his heels, absently rubbing the dirt from his fingers. \"It is good to feel the earth again,\" he said. \"Long has it been since I had leisure to tend growing things, save to defend them with blade and bow. I had almost forgotten what it was like.\"   I can't recall . . . no feel of water, no sound of wind, no memory of tree or grass or flower . . .    Sam shivered. Legolas looked at him with concern. \"Are you all right, Samwise?\"  Sam drew a deep breath, trying to steady himself.  That's over. It's gone, and It won't ever come back.  But beyond the green hills the plain of Gorgoroth stretched black and reeking, and the Mountain of Fire still burned. \"I'm fine,\" he said. \"It was just a chill.\"  But Legolas turned to face him, his bright eyes narrowing as he held Sam in his gaze, and Sam found that he could not look away. Strange to think, how when Legolas had lived with them day by day on the Quest, eating and talking with them and bickering with Gimli, one could almost forget that he was an Elf, much less a Prince. He had seemed only another of the Companions. But now the weight of years uncounted and experience unimagined was full in his eyes as they bore into Sam, and he felt exposed, vulnerable and helpless before that power. He gasped.  The moment passed, and there was only Legolas kneeling before him in his worn hunting tunic, looking as he always had. His eyes no longer pierced, but gazed at Sam with gentle concern. Legolas bowed his head. \"Forgive me,\" he said. \"It was not my intent to frighten you, Master Gamgee. It only seemed to me that you are troubled, and I would help you, if I can.\"  Sam's heart was pounding. He wasn't sure what had just happened, but he felt shaken and weak, as though he had run a league or more in the past few minutes. Was this Elf-magic? \"It's all right,\" he managed. \"You \u2013 you didn't frighten me, Mr. Legolas. I just . . . that is, I should be getting up to the kitchens. Mr. Frodo needs his breakfast.\"  He got to his feet, his knees watery. But Legolas laid a long-fingered hand on his shoulder, and he stilled, trembling. \"I do not doubt your courage, Samwise,\" the Elf said gently. \"If I caused you no distress then I am glad, but still there is a shadow on your heart. I would not seek more than you would tell, but can you not share this with me?\"  Sam stood still, looking down at the tangled hair on his feet for a long moment.  Share this with me . . .  share what? There was much that he could say, but to what purpose? Talking about it wouldn't change anything. And in any case, he hadn't done anything worth mentioning. It was Mr. Frodo who had carried the burden, Mr. Frodo who now suffered the screaming terrors at night. So often had Sam held him, comforted him when he woke shaking from his nightmares, that he could almost forget his own.  He thought of the things that he could never tell Merry or Pippin, and of some that he could not tell even Frodo. He thought of the burning plain: of long days and nights in murky darkness and thirst, of the stench of the pits, and the horror, and the choice that he had made.  \"It was just something Mr. Frodo said, in Mordor,\" he said finally. \"About forgetting the feel of growing things. It was . . . it was bad, that.\"  Legolas' hand tightened briefly on his shoulder and then released him. \"The Shadow was very dark, then,\" he said. \"Even in Gondor I felt it, and many despaired upon the long march to the Morannon.\"  Sam drew a short breath and turned slowly back to face the Elf. \"But you didn't,\" he said.  Legolas held his gaze for a long moment. \"Nor did you, Master Samwise.\" There was a pause. A cool breeze swept over them, ruffling the sapling's leaves. Legolas bent forward slightly, his bright eyes intent. \"Tell me, Sam, why did you go to Mordor?\"  Sam blinked. He had not expected that. \"Because . . . because I had to, Mr. Legolas. I made a promise.\"  \"A promise.\" Legolas nodded. \"And the Shire, Sam? Your Gaffer, and your family, and the lady waiting for you at home?\"  Sam blushed. \"Well, yes, of course it was for them as well. Only, well, I guess we didn't quite know what it all meant, in the beginning I mean. I don't reckon folks at home will ever really understand it all, what Mr. Frodo did for them.\"  \"Perhaps not.\" Legolas' voice was soft. \"But that does not change the value of what he did. He bore what no other could, and he journeyed for all of Middle-earth. But you, Sam? For whom did you go?\"  \"I \u2013 I'm not sure what you mean,\" Sam said. All this talk seemed to be in riddles, and he felt sure that something important was happening, but the meaning slipped away like water through his fingers. \"I just thought Frodo needed me, is all. I promised I would go with him.\"  \"You promised,\" Legolas said. His next words were scarcely audible, as though he spoke only to himself. \"For Frodo\u2026 and for the folk of the Great Wood\u2026 and for love of the Lord of the White Tree.\" *  Sam stared at him in confusion, but Legolas met his eyes, and smiled. \"I think we are much alike, Master Gamgee.\" Sam blushed harder at that, but Legolas seemed not to notice. \"You went to Mordor for Frodo, Sam. I went for Aragorn.\"  l   March 15, 1419. The River Anduin, the Great Fleet from Pelargir   The ship's rigging creaked in the growing wind, the great sails straining forward against their bonds, driving them faster than the sweeps could stroke. But still it was not fast enough for Aragorn. He paced the deck at the bow, his hands locked behind his back and his boots thumping a swift, angry rhythm on the hollow boards. Now and again he would pause, and stare up the great river to where a red glow burned beneath the clouds, his face newly lined and shadowed in the graying light before the dawn.  Legolas watched him, but there was little he could say for comfort. Either they would reach Minas Tirith in time, or they would not. In either case there would be an enemy to fight and battle to be won, and Legolas' chief concern at this moment was that Aragorn would make himself so dizzy with his pacing that he would not be able to wield his sword.  \"Up with your beard,\"** he had said to Gimli, encouraging hope when this morning's wind had yet been beyond the senses of mortals, but neither of his friends had seemed much cheered. In any case the Dwarf had not heeded him, and had gone below instead. He claimed to be checking the hull for leaks, but Legolas rather suspected that his Dwarven friend was seasick. Apparently boats did not agree with Gimli.  The taste of salt was growing stronger. Legolas looked again at Aragorn, who was now visibly clenching his jaw as he paced, and hesitated for a moment. But the wind blew wild and free above, and on it came the tantalizing whisper of salt and spray, and something more: a yearning for something he had never seen. The air upon the deck seemed too thin, the walls of cabin and railings and the press of mortal sailors too close, and he panted, his lungs laboring in swift, shallow gasps. He had to get out. He had to breathe.  He whirled and leaped up to catch the rigging. Never before had he seen a sailing ship, but the ropes came easily to him, and he ran up them, scarcely touching the wooden beams, until he reached the very topmost spar of the great ship's center mast.  Cool, sweet air rushed over him, and he drew it in grateful draughts. The ship rocked in the swells of the river's current, and Legolas felt it shudder as the seasoned wood groaned beneath his hands, he heard the snap of the vast canvas sails and the whine as wet rope stretched. The mast tip swung ten feet or more with every swell. He wrapped his legs around the crossbar to keep from being swept off, and breathed deeply of the wind from the south.  Salt was on the air, but more, there was a feeling beyond his physical senses, a lightness and freedom that stirred within him and spoke to him of that which called to his people from beyond the shores of Middle-earth. It was what he had first felt upon the field of Pelargir, when all turmoil of battle had been swept away and silenced by the cry of the gull. It was the completing chord of Il\u00favatar's Harmony, intrinsic to the Song of the Ainur, at one with the deep rhythm of Creation.  It was the song of the sea.  A gull screamed past him, flying up the river far inland, and he turned to track it as it wheeled on black-tipped wings against the red glow to the north. His Elven eyes could see that fire, drawing ever closer, the leap and flicker of flame in a city of stone, the curl of blackened smoke against the sky.  But the gulls cried, and he looked southward and saw them coming: stubby shapes of white and black that flashed around him in a whirl of beating wings. And greater than their cries there was the song, the song of the sea that swelled within him. He felt its pulse in the rhythm of his heart, in the beat of the blood through his veins, and he knew that he was lost.  And it was  good.  He felt so light, so free from the troubles of Middle-earth, from the threat of this war that had so concerned him. In truth he could not now see why he had cared. It was only a passing darkness, a shadow that was bound to fade, in this Age or the next, in but a few scant lives of Men.  The sea called to him, and that was eternal. He felt as if he could fly to it upon the wings of the gulls, upon the breath of the wind. Tol Eress\u00eba beckoned him, and Aman awaited him, and there would be no hurt there, no grief, for neither pain nor Shadow nor death could touch the blessed shore.  The spray stung his eyes, and the wind whipped the wet strands of his hair about his face, but he did not care. He was soaring, flying in answer to the sea's call, and he spread his arms and laughed for joy, but his voice was swept away and lost in the roar of the wind.  Something rang false. Distantly this filtered to him, as a broken chord in the song that wove around him. The ship was driving north, against the river's current, dragging him away as though to pull the tide from the moon. They were going the wrong way.  It was  wrong.  The discord was stronger now, growing with every stroke of the oars that took him farther from the sea. He felt it as a knot in his stomach, an ache of longing that could not be filled. They had to go back. They had to change course, turn the ship, turn the sails, take in the sweeps \u2013 he was leaping, sliding down the rough-hewn ropes, not feeling the burn of the lines through his hands \u2013 his feet struck the deck before he consciously realized what he was going to do.  Blind, deaf to all but the bone-deep call that compelled him, he ran, slipping between the sailors and D\u00fanedain: Men alien to him, to the world in which he now belonged. They were slow, too slow in their shock to catch him, and he flashed through their midst as an arrow through a thicket. Their cries were meaningless, nonsensical chatter that was drowned by the sea's song. The slick deck narrowed to a thin strip between the main cabin and the rail, and there a barrier loomed: a giant Man who held up thick-corded arms to stop him. Legolas leaped to the side and ran along the slender rail, and was around and past and down again while the Man stood slack-jawed behind him. The deck opened wide again, and there in the stern was the wheel.  Ten feet in diameter it stood, its great spokes silhouetted in the murky light. The sailors who held it were locked in a struggle to keep course along the river, and so never saw the Elf coming. One of them cried out as he seized hold, and another grabbed his arm, but Legolas pivoted, using the Man's own force to draw him off balance and flip him head-over-heels into his companion.  Legolas grasped the wheel, his hands closing naturally over the smooth depressions worn in the giant spokes. He wrenched it hard to port. Shouts went up all over the ship as the vast boom swung 'round, Men scrambling to get out of its way. Legolas strained with all his Elven strength to hold it as the ship groaned and leaned and slowly, slowly began to turn.  \" Legolas!\"  Hard hands gripped his shoulders, wrenching him back, and he whirled with hand raised to strike \u2013 and froze.   Aragorn.   Aragorn stood before him, wind-swept and scraggly as ever, his clothes spattered with mud and blood and a livid bruise from Pelargir blossoming on his cheek.  Aragorn.  His eyes were wide, his hands white-knuckled on Legolas' shoulders.  Aragorn.   Legolas closed his eyes and drew a shuddering breath. The world swayed and tilted with the rise of the deck beneath his feet, as memory came rushing back and collided with the sea's storm within him.  Aragorn.  The War. The Ring. A leaf wrought in green and silver, lying beside a trampled path. The sigh of wind-swept grass and Arod's pounding hooves. Gimli's arms locked about his waist as they raced over the fields of Rohan. Frodo.  Frodo.  Ai, Elbereth, what had he done?  \"Legolas?\" Aragorn's strong fingers dug into his arms. Legolas was beyond answering. The whirl of images filled him, memories of life and love and battle and centuries beneath Greenwood's eaves, and Middle-earth was his home, and it was not. Aman called him, and the sea's song swirled through him, and he had to go, had to answer, and what tie had duty or oath or home upon him now? Abandon the War, abandon the Quest, abandon Frodo, it did not matter, none of it mattered, and  Ai, Elbereth, what had he done?   \"Legolas?\" Worry was now in that voice, panic skirting at its edge.  \"Legolas!\"  Distant pain as he was shaken, limp and unresisting in Aragorn's hands. They sought to draw him away, and a strong shoulder slipped under his to support him, but some sliver of pride remained to him, not yet drowned in the maelstrom of conflicting desire and duty and guilt, and Legolas straightened, lifting his head.  He met the clear grey eyes of the Man, this Ranger who would be King, this mortal who had known him but a scant seventy years, this friend who knew him better than any other. \"Aragorn,\" he whispered. \"Aragorn, what have I done?\"  Aragorn gave a short laugh as he pulled the Elf farther from the helm, away from the dark looks and grumbles of the Men as they worked to put the ship to rights. \"You nearly capsized us for starters, my friend,\" he said. \"And you came close to causing the greatest shipwreck ever seen, turning us straight into the path of the rest of the fleet and nearly concussing half the crew with the boom in the process.\"  They had reached a quiet corner against the railing, and Legolas clutched it, desperate for some physical contact, some stability as Ennor fractured and spun about him. \"No,\" he gasped. \"No, I \u2013\" But his throat closed upon the words.  \"Legolas?\" Gentle now, that voice, in such contrast to its owner's rough appearance. So gentle, so soft, weighted with concern. Legolas gave a low sob of frustration and dug his fingers into the splintered wood of the rail. It pricked his hands, this wood that had seen long voyage and war without time for sanding or polishing. But the pain filtered through a distant haze, and already it seemed unreal, an illusion of the shadow-world around him. Yet Aragorn's voice was clear and real, and Legolas clung to it as to an anchor line against the rising tide.  \"Aragorn.\" It took all his strength of will to form the words, as the fragmented world faded into shades of grey and the gulls screamed overhead. \"Estel, the sea.\"  He heard the Man's sharp intake of breath. He had no hope that he could understand \u2013 Aragorn was mortal; more, he was a mortal raised by Noldor. What could he know of the sea-longing as it stirred in a Sindarin heart? But Aragorn pulled him about so that his back was to the rail, and the shock in his voice spoke of knowledge gained from a lifetime in Lord Elrond's halls. \"Oh, no. Oh, Legolas . . .\"  The haze lifted slightly, and Legolas could see his friend, as if for the first time. Stained and weather beaten, Aragorn's face was haggard and his skin was tinged with grey. He cursed softly in the Silvan tongue \u2013 words that Legolas had taught him. \" Idiot.  Oh, Legolas, how could I be so stupid?\"  Legolas shook his head, pushing back against the rail, struggling to speak. But Aragorn broke away from him, his hands clenching into fists. \"She  told  us! 'Beware of the sea!' But I was so blind, so  stupid!  I didn't even consider that \u2013\"  The call faded slightly in the wake of Aragorn's raw fury. Colors swam before Legolas' eyes, and his voice came weakly, but it came. \"Aragorn, what are you \u2013\"  \"The Paths of the Dead! Valar, I saw it in  his  palant\u00edr! He might have been leading me all the time, and I was so arrogant, I didn't think! Elbereth, ' the cry of the gull on the shore'!  How could I be so  stupid? \"  Legolas stared at him. Only once before had he heard Aragorn speak with such doubt, such self-loathing in his voice. But he had passed that test, and the Ring was far from them now. He took a step forward, and the deck was solid beneath his feet, the world clear about him as he focused on his friend. \"Aragorn, stop. Think for a moment.\"  Aragorn whirled to face him, his hands pushing the hair back from his forehead. \"Think? Valar, Legolas, if I had been thinking you would not be here! I would have sent you on with Th\u00e9oden before I brought you within a hundred leagues of the sea!\"  The longing was pushed back, still strong but bearable now as a trickle of annoyance ran through him. \"'Brought me'? Aragorn, I would challenge you to have stopped me! King of Men you may yet one day be \u2013 but you do not command  me. \"  Aragorn met his eyes, and in that moment he seemed vulnerable, as Legolas had rarely seen him. Aragorn was afraid. \"I would, though,\" he whispered. \"I would keep you safe, Legolas. I could not bear to lose you.\"  Legolas breathed out sharply.  Beloved idiot,  he thought, but before he could say anything a deep voice rang from the prow of the ship. \"Aragorn! We're here! Legolas! We're here! Durin's beard, where are you? You'll miss the battle if you don't hurry up!\"  The ship was suddenly alive with the clank of metal and thump of wood, Men's voices shouting orders, the hiss of the anchors running through their ports and the whoosh and thud as sails lowered. As if awakening from a dream, Legolas saw that day was full upon them. The air was thick with smoky haze.  Men turned toward them, waiting for orders, but Aragorn yet hesitated. Legolas looked past him, to where the broken pilings stood ranked upon the shoreline, the half-ruined port stretching toward the low roar of flame in the distance. Small black figures scuttled between the shells of houses.  Orcs had claimed the town of Men. Beyond them Minas Tirith burned. And beyond that there stretched the fields of Rohan, and the forests of Fangorn and Lothl\u00f3rien, and Eryn Galen. And beneath his feet the river flowed, and behind him the sea stretched into the uttermost West, and there would be no war there, no hurt or pain or grief. But before him Aragorn stood, and fear was in his eyes.  He had given so much, this Man. Through the years Legolas had seen him grow from stripling youth to weathered Ranger, seen him bear the slights and scorn of other Men, even those protected by the D\u00fanedain. And still the light of nobility shone in him, and strength of will and honor greater than in any Man Legolas had ever known.  And now there was fear. Fear in this Man who was named for hope; who had resisted all the trials and temptations of the Enemy; who only days before faced the Dark Lord himself, and vanquished him. Legolas had stood guard, and watched, all through that dark night as Aragorn fought his silent battle. He had felt the crushing horror of Sauron's power in the palant\u00edr, and the bitter struggle of Aragorn's resistance. Yet never had he doubted the result, for he knew his friend's strength.  But Aragorn was drawn and shaken, exhausted as Legolas had rarely seen him. The Elf half-raised his hand, as if to touch the weathered planes of the Man's face.  I could not bear to lose you . And what, Legolas wondered, of himself? Was he then to stay, to bear the loss that Aragorn could not? Already this twice beloved Elf-friend had changed so much, had grown worn and weary with the cares of but a few passing decades. Legolas had seen the knowledge in Arwen's eyes as time grew precious, hoarded and shared between them, parceled in the look and touch and voice of this mortal whom they both loved.  He knew then that there was no choice. In truth there never had been. It was not duty that compelled him, nor oath, nor even home. It was love.  Legolas lowered his hand and grasped Aragorn's wrist in the warrior's clasp. \"Go,\" he said. \"They need you.\"  Aragorn returned the grip, holding him tightly. \"And you?\" he asked.  Legolas took a long breath. In that moment the worlds hung balanced, and he felt again the pure longing, the joy of the sea's song untainted. He looked into the troubled eyes of this mortal Man, and spoke the words that set his fate. \"Your friends are with you, Aragorn,\" he said. \"I am with you.\"   Always , he added silently, and the world tilted and he felt himself firmly set in Middle-earth, and the sweet longing of the sea changed in that moment to aching grief. A gull screamed overhead and the sound cut him like a knife's blade, and he gasped. But Aragorn was watching him still, so Legolas smiled grimly and said, \"Go. If we tarry longer, Gimli will leave no Orcs for us.\"  Aragorn returned his smile and drew him close in a swift, fierce embrace. When he broke away the years seemed less heavy upon him, and his eyes were clear, free of doubt or fear. He called to the Men, and with a roar they answered him, and the planks shuddered under their feet as they rushed to the shore. And though the gulls cried and wheeled away from the battle, back down the river toward the sea, Legolas stayed at Aragorn's side, and he did not look back.  l   June 26, 1419. Minas Tirith, Gondor.   \"For Aragorn?\" Sam sounded uncertain.  Legolas was still for a long moment. \"For many things,\" he said at last. \"But for Aragorn most of all.\" He drew a slow breath. \"From the time of our first awakening, the Elves were bound to Middle-earth. For the Sindar, even the Valar's call could not break that bond, though the longing never fades.\"  He cupped the damp earth between his hands, but hardly saw it. \"Well do I know the toll Sauron exacted from the people of Greenwood. I would have gone to the Gates, if only to bear witness for my kin slain at Dagorlad. I would have brought honor to Eryn Galen, if it were in my power, and welcomed my death, if in dying I could strike against Him.\" His voice trailed off as he said this, truths that he had never before voiced aloud. His people, his home . . . he would have died for them. At one time, he had thought that was enough.  He closed his eyes. \"But even all of this would not have kept me from despair.\"  There was a pause. Then Sam said quietly, as though unsure of himself, \"Well, no. It wouldn't, would it?\"  Legolas opened his eyes. The Hobbit met his gaze and then glanced away. He spoke slowly, as if feeling the words out for the first time. \"I mean, it all seemed so far away, home and all, when we were there, in Mordor, I mean. Sometimes it felt like the Shire was . . . was just a place on the map, someplace I'd heard of, but didn't have no real memory of. Almost like it was a dream, if you follow me.\"  Legolas nodded slowly. \"And having once awakened, you can find no further comfort in it.\" He paused for a long moment, studying the small being before him. \"Frodo was very fortunate to have you with him, Sam.\"  Sam shifted uncomfortably, but Legolas continued. \"He has awakened, I deem, to far more than he should ever have had to know. Whether he can find peace in the dream again, I do not know.\"  Sam frowned. \"But that's . . . that's not quite right, begging your pardon, Mr. Legolas. The Shire, Bag End: it  isn't  a dream. I just meant, that's the way it felt, when things were so black and all. But we'll be going home again soon. Mr. Frodo will be all right then.\"  \"Will he?\" Legolas' voice was gentle. \"For his sake, I hope that you are right, Samwise. It is more than he should have to bear, to give up his home and the ones he loves.\" He fell silent, and reached out to brush his fingertips lightly over the slender tree's trunk. \"This is the first,\" he murmured. \"Soon the Elven Rings will leave Middle-earth, and the Age we have known will be at an end.\" He glanced at Sam and said, \"Then I will come to the Shire, Master Gamgee, and we shall see. At the last, I will come.\"  l   September 20, 1421. The Shire.   There was a mistake. Legolas was wrong: it wasn't time yet. \"The last\" \u2013 Sam didn't know what that meant. Frodo was going to Rivendell, true, but he was coming back again soon \u2013 soon, he was,  he was . It was a  mistake , some Elvish mystery, it had nothing to do with Frodo or Sam or the Shire, and what did it matter which Age you called it, they would endure, nothing was changing, he was  wrong,  it was all a mistake!  Sam opened his mouth to tell Legolas this, but the words that came out were quite different. He looked up at the Elf and said, \"Frodo is leaving.\"  As if the act of saying it had released something within him, his knees buckled, and he swayed violently. Legolas dropped swiftly to one knee and caught him, the Elf's arms folding around him and holding him close as dry sobs shook his body. There were no tears. Sam was beyond them, and the tearing gasps burned like fire in his chest. \"He's leaving. He's leaving. He's leaving.\"  Legolas said nothing, but held him against his chest, rocking gently as the grief ran its course. Finally Sam stilled, shuddering, and for a time they remained thus in silence.  Slowly Sam came back to himself, became aware of the birdsong that flitted around them, the leather of the Elf's tunic crushed under his cheek, the autumn roses' fragrance mixed with a scent like summer rain. Legolas' hair was tickling his nose.  He moved back, and the Elf released him, but remained there, kneeling on the garden path. Sam hardly dared look at him. What must Legolas think of him? What would Elanor think if she saw her father like this, being comforted like a child? What would Rosie say?  But Legolas only watched him, and there was no scorn, no condemnation in the Elf's clear gaze. \"It is all right, Samwise,\" he said gently.  Sam shook his head, struggling for control. \"No, it isn't,\" he said. \"It's not all right. Nothing's all right. Don't you understand? He's leaving. Mr. Frodo's  leaving. \"  \"I know.\" Legolas sighed. \"It is the last, and all the world is changing. Even in Ithilien I felt it. The Ring-bearers are leaving Middle-earth.\"  \"But  why? \" Sam turned away, his hands clenching as he stared unseeing over the faded garden. \"He's been ill, I know. He just needs \u2013 rest. He drives himself too hard, I've told him again and again, he has to take care of himself, he can't expect to \u2013\"  \"Sam,\" Legolas broke in. \"Frodo cannot \u2013\"  \"But this is his  home! \" Sam cried. He broke off, staring at Legolas, his chest heaving. \"How can he leave his home? How can he leave Bag End, and Mr. Merry, and Mr. Pippin, and Rosie and Elanor and \u2013\" he stopped, breathing hard. His pulse was pounding in his temples. \"How can he leave us?\" he whispered.  Legolas bowed his head. His lithe form was rigid, quivering slightly with some violently suppressed emotion. \"He does not wish to,\" he said. His musical voice was low and strained with grief. \"What hurt Frodo bears may be healed across the sea, but to be parted forever from those he loves . . . that is a wound from which he may never recover.\"  \"Then why go?\" Sam asked. He felt weak, beyond grief or anger, left only with simple wonder. \"If this is his home, and he wants to stay, why is he going?\"  Legolas raised his head slowly, and his eyes were steeped in such pain that Sam caught his breath. \"Because he must,\" the Elf whispered. \"If ever he is to be healed, he must. Have you ever heard the cry of the gulls, Samwise?\"  Sam shook his head.  \"No,\" Legolas said. \"No. But I have.\" His slender shoulders moved as he drew breath. \"I would hope that you do hear them one day, Samwise, for they are beautiful. They are beautiful,\" he repeated, as if to remind himself of a truth forgotten. \"They cut the sky with bladed wings, and their cries are like the clarion ring of freedom, calling you home, to peace. Though all the world I love be broken away beneath me, I would not have forgone hearing them, even now.\"  Now the tears stung Sam's eyes, and he blinked to clear them. His throat was choked so that he could hardly speak. \"But this is Frodo's home.\"  \"It is,\" Legolas said. His eyes were very dark as they looked into Sam's, and his voice was almost pleading. It was as if he were seeking some understanding, or forgiveness. \"And the friendship he bears you is enough to tear him apart, for he loves you, Sam, as you love him. But the Valar have called him, and he cannot find peace here any longer. For his sake, you must let him go.\"  Sam closed his eyes. He was trembling. \"I can't.\"  \"Samwise, you must \u2013\"  \" No! \" Sam shouted. He threw out an arm, as if to ward off the Elf's words. \"I  can't! \" He stared at Legolas, breathing hard, his heart pounding. \"Don't you understand? I made a promise.\"  \"But the Quest \u2013\"  \"A  promise ,\" Sam repeated. There was a roaring in his ears, and golden afternoon dimmed before his eyes. The soft air seemed too hot to breathe, and a black reek was in his nostrils. \"And I broke it. I left him.\"   The wind had whipped stinging sand about them, as he knelt there with his master's body. The blackened earth had scorched his feet, and his tears had dried in the searing wind, and he had taken It. He had taken It, and broken his word, and left Frodo there alone. And It had been horrible, hard and heavy and sick with malice about his neck, but hadn't he . . . hadn't some part of him . . .?   \"No.\" Legolas' voice was firm, cutting clear and strong as a white blade through the shadows. \"You did not. What choice you made, Samwise, was for the sake of the Quest. It was for the sake of us all.\"  Sam's vision cleared, and he was again in his own garden, and the birds were singing. \"But it wasn't,\" his voice cracked. \"It wasn't for me to go putting myself up like that and taking It from him. My place was with him. I should have stayed with him.\"  A thin line drew between Legolas' dark brows. \"And if you had?\" he asked. \"What then? Frodo was captured by the Orcs. Had you been with him \u2013\"  \"I would have killed them! I would have \u2013\"  \"You would have been killed, or captured with him, and the Enemy would have regained the Ring.\" Legolas' frown deepened. \"You know this, Samwise. Frodo himself told us as much, in the Houses of Healing. Why then do you \u2013\"  \"But he didn't know!\" Sam burst out. \"When he, when that horrible Shelob \u2013 when I took It from him \u2013\" He stopped. Taking a deep breath, he said at last, \"When I left him, it was wrong. I knew it was wrong, I could feel it, but I did it anyway. And when I took the Ring, I \u2013\" He broke off. There was a long pause, while he struggled to speak and Legolas watched him, still and silent as only an Elf could be.  \"I wanted It,\" Sam finished at last. His breath was like a sob. \"I left him, I broke my promise, and I wanted It. Some part of me wanted It, and even though I knew it was wrong, I left him anyway. It was so wrong. And now, how can parting from him be right?\"  The question hung between them. In the silence Sam could hear the chatter of a squirrel in the hazel thicket, and the sharp scolding cry of a jay. His mouth was dry and his limbs felt weak. He had said it, this awful truth that he had not spoken, had not told anyone, not even Frodo. What would Legolas think of him now?  But when at last he brought himself to meet the Elf's eyes, Legolas smiled at him. \"Think you that you were the only one so tempted, Samwise Gamgee?\" he asked.  That stopped him for a moment. \"I \u2013 I don't know,\" Sam admitted. \"No, I . . . I suppose not. That Gollum, and \u2013\" He stopped. What had happened in the Crack of Doom was for Frodo to tell, or not, and he would not speak of it.  Legolas nodded. \"And Boromir,\" he said, \"and Bilbo, and Isildur, and Aragorn.\" He paused. \"It is not a weakness to be tempted. That was the nature of the Ring. What matters far more, it seems to me, is how you responded to the temptation. And you, Samwise the Brave, resisted It.\"  Sam stared at the packed earth of the path beneath his feet. \"But I didn't think about that,\" he said. \"I just knew I needed to go back to Frodo. That was what it was, not any fine ideas about honor or the Quest or any of the rest of it. I just never should have left him. So you see,\" he said, lifting his hands, \"I can't break my promise. If I let him go, that part of me, that part of me that liked It \u2013\"  \"Will be defeated, just as it was before,\" Legolas said firmly. \"It was not Frodo that drove it back, Samwise Gamgee, but you yourself.\" One corner of his mouth lifted in a wry half-smile. \"Only the second Ring-bearer,\" he said, \"to give It up willingly.\"  Sam didn't quite know what to say to that. While he hesitated, Legolas fixed him with a piercing gaze. \"I would appreciate it,\" he said, \"if you did not repeat what I am about to say next to the Dwarf.\"  Sam blinked. \"Gimli?\" he said. \"Oh. All right.\"  Legolas nodded once. \"Good.\" He took a breath and glanced from side to side as if to ensure that no one was listening. \"Elves,\" he said solemnly, \"are not perfect.\"  Sam snorted in surprise and clamped a hand over his mouth. Legolas smiled and sat back, his eyes dancing. But he swiftly grew more somber, and his gaze was distant when next he spoke. \"When first I heard the gulls upon the field of Pelargir, it was as nothing I had heard before. I stood dumb, the battle forgotten, and had Gimli not struck me with his axe-handle I think it likely that I would have fallen to an Orc blade then and there.\"  He sighed. \"Later, on the ship as we sailed to Minas Tirith, I knew. I knew what they would do to me, and still I sought them out. I gave myself up to it, the sea-longing, and I think I went a little mad with it. I do not remember, exactly, but had it not been for Aragorn . . .\"  His eyes focused again on Sam, with startling intensity. \"You see, Samwise, temptation comes in many forms. I resisted the Ring, and I did not fear the Dead. But show me one sea-gull . . .\"  A smile flashed and was gone, like a ray of sunlight between the clouds, and Sam could not help grinning back. But Legolas' next words were hard and cold, and his voice so bitter that it raised the hairs at the back of Sam's neck.  \"One sea-gull, and I forgot my duty. Centuries of discipline, of training, of service to my King and people, oaths of honor and kinship, even this land that I love: I forgot them all. I would have forsaken the Quest; I would have abandoned Frodo to his fate and let Minas Tirith burn. I would have let Middle-earth fall to darkness, but for Aragorn.\"  Legolas' eyes were dark, but Sam could not look away. \"You could not leave Frodo, and I could not leave Aragorn. Now tell me, Master Gamgee, which of us is weak?\"  Sam swallowed. \"I guess . . . I guess we both are, Mr. Legolas. Only \u2013\" He hesitated, trying to find the right words. \"I don't rightly know that it's a weakness, if you follow me. Maybe it's more our strength. Standing by your friends, that seems more important to me than all these noble ideas about duty and honor and all the rest of it.\"  Legolas stared at him. Sam blushed.  There you go, Samwise Gamgee, putting your foot in it again, makin' speeches when you ought to keep quiet . But Legolas did not seem offended. \"Perhaps you are right,\" he said. \"Perhaps for friendship . . .\" He was still for a long moment. When at last he spoke his voice was soft, and threaded with such pain that the tears started again in Sam's eyes. \"For friendship, I have sworn one oath at least that I cannot break. And for love, I would not wish to do so. The sea is not yet so great that it cannot wait a while.\"  Sam's heart felt as if it would split in two, and it was a moment before he could speak. But at last he whispered, \"For friendship, I would have Frodo healed, and find peace. For love, I would . . .\" He couldn't say it. He dashed a hand across his eyes, and his voice cracked as he burst out, \"But does it have to be forever? Couldn't Lord Elrond just \u2013 just heal him and send him back?\"  Legolas opened his arms, and Sam ran to him, and uncaring who might see, or what anyone might think, he threw himself upon the Elf's shoulder as the storm took him. When it had passed, leaving him in gasping sobs and Legolas' tunic quite damp, he found that the Elf was holding him close, one slender hand stroking his hair while Legolas hummed gently beneath his breath.  For a time Sam drifted, numb, upon the soft waves of Elven song. Then Legolas whispered, so quietly that he almost did not hear it, \"Perhaps not forever. You are a Ring-bearer and an Elf-friend, Samwise Gamgee, and you have much yet to do in Middle-earth. But . . . perhaps not forever.\"  l   September 22, 1482. The Fourth Age of Middle-earth.   The last pages were complete. Their heavy parchment caught the roughened edges of Sam's fingers, thickened now with knuckles swollen by the arthritis that crept on, a little worse with every winter. But today was warm, and the gentle breeze that sighed through the open window carried the fragrance of autumn roses.  The pages rippled backwards under his stiff hands, a story stretching over a century in the telling, as his careful script gave way to Frodo's flowing hand, back to Bilbo's spidery scrawl at the beginning of it all.  Something was different. There was a feeling, a changing, he thought, in the air. It was crisper, sharper somehow, and strange breezes seemed to creep into the empty corners of Bag End Under Hill. He found himself looking through the old maps again, tracing the journey they had made. But more and more he sought the western borders, remembering that last journey with Mr. Frodo, when Merry and Pippin had surprised them at the Havens.  Legolas had not gone with them. It was not yet his time, he said, and slipped away before Frodo had set out. But Sam wondered, when Merry and Pippin came riding up, laughing and crying at once, if the Elf had not had business elsewhere.  Sam was restless. That was it. His legs felt twitchy, and he caught up his old walking stick and was halfway to the open door before he stopped and set it down again. Rosie would say he was being an old fool. But Rosie was gone.  He would not think about that. Instead he wandered back to the study, and stood looking down at the heavy book that lay upon the desk, its cover worn but still intact. The binding had cracked and been repaired, and the pages were not as stiff as they had once been. He turned it slowly to the end, and looked at the very last few pages. There was room, he thought, for a little more.  With a little effort he pulled the chair back, its legs scraping over the wooden floor. He sat, a careful movement, lowering himself as far as his creaking knees would permit, and then the final drop and grunt onto the cushion. When this was accomplished he paused, collecting himself for the next task. In the distance, clear upon the smoke-spiced air, he thought he heard the coming clop of a horse's hooves.  He trimmed a quill with careful precision and opened the inkbottle, a sharp twinge running up his arm as he pried the cork loose. The hoof-beats had stopped. He listened, but though his ears were sharp as ever he did not hear footsteps.  Ah well,  he thought,  the door is open.   He loaded the quill and held it over the open page. Much of it had been filled already with the small activities of the Shire, his long years as Mayor, the births and lives and marriages of the Travelers' children. All were grown now; all were gone on to families of their own. Merry and Pippin had been talking lately of making another journey, back to see Rohan again, and Gondor. He liked the idea of traveling again.  The birds in the garden were making an amazing racket. He took a deep breath.  It is time , he thought. And with firm strokes he wrote,  1482. Death of Mistress Rose, wife of Master Samwise, on Mid-year's Day.  He hesitated, wanting to say more. He thought about her eyes and her smile, and the way her mouth would quirk when he had done something foolish, letting the children have blackberry pie for breakfast, and she was trying not to laugh at him. He had held her hand, felt the paper-thin skin beneath his own, and he had kissed her, and told her that he would come soon. And the corner of her mouth had quirked. \"Don't be foolish, Sam,\" she had said. \"There's time enough for that later. Now you have things left to attend to.\"   There is time enough .  I would like to see the Elves again.  His pack had been ready by the door for the past two weeks. He dipped his quill again and wrote,  On September 22 Master Samwise rides out from Bag End.  He thought to say more, but stopped. That was for Elanor, now. He carefully blotted the last lines and then closed the book.  There was a faint scraping in the doorway behind him, and he smiled.  Deliberate  ,  he thought. Without looking around he said, \"You've come.\"  \"It is time, Master Gamgee,\" Legolas replied. \"I could do no less.\"  l  They rode through the golden afternoon, along green avenues shaded by the trees that Sam had planted so long ago. Legolas often sang as they traveled, reminding Sam of the journey with the Fellowship, when Gimli had asked if it were some weakness of the species that made Elves chirp continually like the birds.  But as the days passed, and each evening's setting sun stretched their shadows out behind them, Legolas sang less often, and finally they rode in silence. It was on the third day after they had left Tower Hills, where Sam gave Elanor the Red Book, that Legolas halted in the middle of the road.  Sam rode a few paces farther before he realized that the Elf had stopped. He pulled his pony's rein, twisting about to see what was wrong. The pony snorted and turned, tossing its head, but Legolas did not seem to notice. He stood as if stricken, there beside his great horse, and the freshening breeze swept back long tendrils of his hair.  \"Can you hear it?\" he whispered.  \"Hear what?\" Sam asked.  \"The sea.\" Legolas closed his eyes. \"The song of the sea.\"  Sam didn't know what to say. He was silent while the Elf stood motionless, his face turned toward the West and his lips parted as if to drink in something that only he could hear. When at last Legolas opened his eyes again they were dark and full of such longing that Sam felt it as an ache in his own heart.  \"I can go no farther,\" Legolas said. \"Forgive me, Samwise. I thought . . . I had thought that I was stronger than this.\"  Sam hesitated. It might only make it worse, but still he had to offer. \"You could come with me,\" he suggested timidly. \"Frodo would \u2013\"  Legolas smiled, but in it there was such pain that the words locked in Sam's throat. \"My family will follow me, one day,\" he said. \"And Ennor live on in song and memory, most beloved in Sindarin hearts. But to leave Aragorn . . .\" He stopped and swallowed hard.  \"Shall the moon then leave the earth,\" he whispered, \"and the stars leave Varda's cloak to wander free?\" He shook his head. \"Nay. Gimli may yet one day win favor in the West, and seek the treasure he desires beyond the gems beneath the earth. But Aragorn will stay.\"  He looked into Sam's eyes, and Sam looking back saw that Legolas had not changed since first Sam had seen him at the Council sixty years and more ago. Legolas was as strong and beautiful as he had been that day, his lithe body still clad in hunting green, his quiver and knives strapped at his back together with the great bow of Galadriel. He stood, immortality captured in eternal youth while the world aged and changed around him.  \"Some partings are forever, Sam,\" he said. \"But when I part from Aragorn, it will not be by my choosing.\"  Sam blinked hard, and on impulse he grasped his saddle and swung stiffly down from the pony's back. He staggered upon landing, and Legolas dropped down and caught him. But as Sam held him close he felt the Elf shake, and he thought that this was not so much for his comfort as for Legolas'.  \"You'll come,\" he said fiercely. \"One day, you'll come, and we will see you there.\"  Legolas took him by the shoulders and held him back, and Sam saw the tears shining in his eyes as he smiled. \"Elvellon,\" he said. \"Perhaps. I know not what fate may bring, nor how long the Gift may be withheld from you in the Undying Lands. But one day, perhaps.\"   One day . In a month, a life, a hundred years of Men. Legolas had said that once, making light of the longing, and not even Aragorn knew what that deception had cost him.  One day Aragorn would die, and the sea's call would be answered. But it was not this day, and Legolas would not wish it to be, not though the pain should tear him apart. He lifted Sam up and set the old hobbit gently on his pony. C\u00edrdan awaited him, and Merry and Pippin would come to see him keep his promise and join his master again.  Legolas stood still and watched as Sam journeyed at last beyond even Elven sight. And in the beat of his heart he felt the eternal pulse of the sea, and on the wind he heard the crying of the gulls."}

Blinking in the sunlight and leaning his back against the warm stone of the Deeping Wall, Gimli stared at what appeared to be a bundle of sticks with a few token leaves. \"I thought your gardening efforts were confined to Ithilien and Minas Tirith,\" he said, making no effort to take the tree.  \"This is not a  gardening effort ,\" Legolas answered. \"This is a gesture of good will from the Elves of Ithilien. Among my people, there is a legend that tells of how Yavanna went forth when the world was yet barren and planted a rowan tree. And from that rowan, she culled the seeds that gave rise to all other plants and trees.\"  \"All plants come from the rowan tree?\" Gimli said, raising his brow and looking pointedly at first the spindly sapling and then the soft, willowy grass that lined the banks of the Deeping Stream. \"Perhaps we have been too long in the sun.\"  \"It is only a legend,\" Legolas said curtly, the muscles in his jaw bunching. \"You have no need to give credence to it, and you have no need to accept the gift. But I would ask that you at least accept the thought behind the gift. For the Silvan Elves, the gift of a rowan tree is a symbol of hope and bounty. They are trees that survive many climes and many circumstances, and such would be my wish for the Dwarves.\"  Now feeling somewhat chagrined, Gimli reached out and gingerly took the sapling. \"My apologies,\" he said. \"I did not mean to give offense. And you have also my thanks, both for the gift and the thought.\" Looking down, he eyed the tree in his hands and wondered what he was supposed to do with it. It felt small and frail, as though one awkward movement might snap it in twain. A youth's hammer had more substance than this! At length, Gimli looked back to his elven friend and opted for honest confusion. \"Legolas, I know nothing of caring for a tree.\"  \"That is no concern,\" Legolas answered, seemingly mollified. \"The tree will care for itself. I had thought to plant it above the Hornburg. There is a broad cutting in the rock above the Deep as well as a trail that runs up to it. When last I walked it, I spied a crevice on the ledge that had a goodly amount of soil. This rowan should do well there.\"  Gimli frowned. He knew the trail of which Legolas spoke. It snaked its way back and forth across the base of the mountain against which Helm's Deep had been built. From this mountain foundation rose three peaks, known to the Riders as the Thrihyrne, and the trail gouged a path upward toward their steep slopes, ending just below the gorge that separated the southernmost peak from the middle. Here, the trail became a narrow ledge that offered an unobstructed view of the Hornburg, the Hornrock, and the rich vale beyond that was the Deeping Coomb. Gimli had already selected this ledge as a good place for thought and solitude. He had not selected it as a good place for the beginnings of a forest. \"Will it be able to take root there? And what of water?\"  \"It will gather what it needs from the mountain,\" Legolas assured him. \"Snow and soil can both be found on those slopes, and I chose this particular rowan for its ability to thrive where others might falter.\"  \"And what must I do to ensure its survival?\" Gimli asked with no small amount of trepidation.  \"Naught,\" Legolas said. \"Simply enjoy it.\"  Gimli looked down again at the sapling in his hands. \"You will not censure me if it comes to harm?\"  \"Only if you take your axe to it,\" Legolas said. He paused, then, his brow furrowing. \"You are not planning to take your axe to it, are you?\"  Such a question more than justified the mud that Gimli lobbed at Legolas's head.    Thus the tree was planted, and soon all of Helm ' s Deep knew of the rowan that sprouted from a crevice high above the Hornburg. When he could escape his duties, Gimli visited it often, marveling at the way its roots delved deep into the mountain side. No single crevice was large enough to provide all the support that the growing sapling might need, but the rowan did not draw strength from a single crevice. It anchored itself in a multitude of gaps and fissures, and after the span of a few years, the roots widened the gaps, allowing additional water and soil to succor the tree. And despite its rocky surroundings, the rowan began to flourish.    \"You are quiet today,\" Gimli murmured, sitting beside the rowan tree and looking out over the hazy plains of the Riddermark. Dust and smoke tinged the air, signs that Rohan's harvest now drew to a close.  \"Do you wish for conversation?\" Legolas asked. He stood close enough to the edge of the rocky shelf to make Gimli uncomfortable, despite nearly four years of friendship in which he had come to know just how sure-footed his companion was.  \"No,\" Gimli answered, \"but I thought perhaps that you did.\"  Legolas turned toward Gimli, his eyes questioning. \"May I ask what prompted that conclusion?\"  Gimli dusted off his pants and stood, absently fingering a limb of the rowan tree as he did so. \"Because you have no other business here in Aglarond. There are no matters of trade or politics for us to discuss. Indeed, the only matters we have discussed are the canyon winds and Rohan's harvest.\"  \"Perhaps I find the canyon winds refreshing.\"  \"And perhaps you might find similar canyon winds at the feet of the Ephel Duath.\"  The Elf's eyes narrowed. \"Very well, then. I came for the pleasure of your company. I cannot now fathom what prompted me to do such a thing.\"  But Gimli refused to be baited and instead turned his eyes to the sprawling grasslands beyond Helm's Deep, his heart heavy. \"Why did you not go with them?\"  \"Of whom do you speak?\" Legolas asked, but there was a sudden catch in his voice.  \"Frodo,\" Gimli answered, his own voice dropping to a low murmur. \"Gandalf. Elrond. The Lady Galadriel. Did they not ask if you wished to accompany them?\"  A heavy silence descended during which Legolas folded his arms tightly across his chest and turned away. Gimli did not press him, partly because he did not understand this strange affliction, partly because he had not the faintest idea of how to respond to it, and partly because he was not sure he even wanted an answer. Word had come a month ago that the Ring-bearer had sailed, leaving Middle-earth forever, and Gimli felt a keen sense of loss at the thought that he would never see Frodo again. Gandalf, too, had left them, along with many Elves that Gimli had come to know and respect. He could only thank Mahal that Legolas had not been among them, but the cause of his gratitude was also the cause of his confusion. Legolas had professed his Sea-longing countless times, yet still he lingered. Why?  \"They asked,\" Legolas said at length, his words slow and quiet, \"and I considered. But though the Sea calls, there are others here with louder voices. I cannot abandon them. Nor can I abandon the settlement I have begun in Ithilien. Not now. Such an act would betray the trust of those who followed me. But perhaps most compelling of all my reasons,\" he added, turning back to Gimli with a twinkle in his eyes, \"are a handful of mortals\u2014in particular, a certain Dwarf\u2014who would surely come to grief without me.\"  Inwardly, Gimli felt as though he had just uncovered a rich vein of  mithril , but outwardly, he schooled his face into a look of indignation. \"We would come to grief without you, would we? Perhaps I should remind a certain Elf of the grief he caused when he asked a certain Dwarf to join him last year in searching the Dead Marshes for orcs. And perhaps I should also remind him of how he still owes me a pair of boots!\"  Legolas laughed, and some of the shadows faded from his eyes. \"Then allow me to remind you of how I saved your axe from the quagmire at the expense of my quiver.\"  \"As the entire disaster was of your own making, saving my axe does not annul your debt to my feet,\" Gimli returned.  The Elf smiled and shook his head. \"I will see what can be done,\" he answered, which meant that he would forget about it by the next day. Elves were like that, but at the moment, Gimli was content with the fact that Legolas had not sailed and that there would  be  a next day.  He leaned backed against the mountainside, ducking as the rowan tree caught on his hair and beard. \"Your gift is doing well,\" he observed, batting thin branches away.  \"So, too, are your people,\" Legolas said. \"Their numbers swell. I am surprised you convinced so many of them to come. It was my understanding that Dwarves are reluctant to create new homes.\"  \"We are. The call of heritage holds us close to our ancient strongholds. But as you have already observed, sometimes there are stronger voices.\"  \"And Aglarond is one such voice?\"  \"Perhaps,\" Gimli mused. \"Or perhaps there are those who would see us thrive one last time ere we are worn away.\"    Years passed, and the rowan grew, sending forth many branches as its roots continued to dig deep into the mountain. In the spring, its flowers were as tiny snowflakes bobbing gently above the Hornburg, and in the fall, its leaves gleamed golden as they danced and twisted in the wind. For Gimli, the tree became a sanctuary of sorts. Even if he had not the time for the steep trek up toward the Thrihyrne, he could still look up and see the lone rowan. All in Helm ' s Deep could, and all drew strength from the tree that clung to the mountain. Even the winter storms could not harm it, for it was both sheltered and rooted by rock. And as the tree grew, so grew the dwarven colony of Aglarond.    \"Your people are busy,\" Legolas remarked, watching the wains exit the gates of Helm's Deep and descend down into the Deeping Coomb. His golden hair gleamed in the sunlight, and his breath came in misty puffs as the chill of the spring morning fought the warming of the day.  \"As  I  should be,\" Gimli said, making no effort to be subtle about wanting to return to his duties. He was still uncertain as to how Legolas had persuaded him to climb the trail to the rowan tree. He had far too much to do. Aragorn had requested the aid of many dwarven craftsmen in an attempt to restore Osgiliath, and their absence was making it difficult to meet the trade expectations of Meduseld, Minas Tirith, Belfalas, Lebennin, Dale, Erebor, the Shire, and even parts of Rh\u00fbn and Harad. The departing wagons were bound for Dol Amroth, some of their contents having been completed only late the previous evening thanks to the efforts of frantic smiths in the forges. The wains would arrive several days late, which was more than could be said for the shipments bound for the Iron Hills. Those wains were not yet assembled, and they should have started north a week ago. If only Gimli had returned from the Lonely Mountain sooner\u2026  If only he could put to rest the memories of his father's death\u2026  \"Were I to allow you to be as busy as you feel you should be, then I would see nothing of you and my visit here would be wasted,\" Legolas said, neatly breaking into Gimli's thoughts. \"Moreover, it is tradition that we visit the rowan.\"  Gimli sighed and looked at the tree, knowing he was proving to be an ill host but having neither the time nor the energy to apologize for it. His recent trip to the Lonely Mountain weighed heavily upon him, and when he had naught to distract his mind, his thoughts wandered back to Erebor where his father now lay entombed in the Hall of Durin's Kin. He had stood vigil over the departed for as long as his responsibilities would permit, and then he had all but fled, hurrying back to Aglarond before grief could overtake him completely. \"Is our business here concluded?\" he asked. \"I have much yet to accomplish, and the morning wanes.\"  \"The morning has barely begun, and your obligations can wait. I will not allow haste to cheapen our tradition of visiting the rowan.\"  \"Sometimes tradition must give way to obligation,\" Gimli said, looking pointedly at the trail that would return them to Helm's Deep. But the moment he finished speaking, a strange feeling of uncertainty arose. Blinking at this sudden shift in mood, Gimli turned back to Legolas and immediately found the source of the change. Legolas's face might have been chiseled from stone, but his eyes flickered in a way that Gimli had come to recognize as unease. \"Legolas?\" Gimli questioned, frowning.  The Elf pressed his lips together in a thin line. \"You speak of tradition and obligation,\" he said, and his voice seemed strained. \"That is, in fact, why I have come.\"  Suddenly suspicious, Gimli studied Legolas carefully. \"I thought you came as part of Eowyn's retinue.\"  \"Her desire to see her brother provided an opportunity I could not overlook,\" Legolas said. \"It was an easy thing to offer my company on the journey, especially since Faramir was needed in Osgiliath and could not accompany her himself. But had Eowyn not wished to journey to Rohan, I would have come alone. For your welfare, I could do no less.\"  Over the years, Gimli had learned that the amount of time it took Legolas to state his purpose was directly related to how unsettling that purpose was. This knowledge, coupled with the fact that Legolas looked decidedly anxious, informed Gimli that if he wanted to resume his responsibilities in the near future, he would have to force Legolas to come to the point. \"Then if it is not for Eowyn, why are you here? And do not say it is simply to visit me! There is more to this than that.\"  Doubt flooded the Elf's face. \"You have not yet guessed? I know somewhat of dwarven tradition in these matters, but\u2026\" He trailed off, his jaw tight.  \"Of what dwarven tradition do you speak, and in what matters?\" Gimli demanded, but his heart had begun to pound within his chest.  \"Perhaps I am too bold in this,\" Legolas murmured, and he turned away from Gimli to cast his eyes outward over Rohan. \"I thought that with your mother in the Lonely Mountain, you might wish for\u2026 No,\" he said, shaking his head sharply and making as though to leave. \"I presume overmuch. My apologies. It was not my intention to\u2014\"  \"Hold,\" Gimli whispered, closing his eyes against a sudden flood of tears. \"You have yet to answer me. Of what dwarven tradition do you speak?\"  Silence hung heavy in the air, as dauntless and imposing as the mountains, and then in a voice that sounded as though it came from a great distance, Legolas answered, \"I speak of those traditions regarding grief and mourning.\"  Gimli's throat seemed to close. It was with great effort that he choked out his next words. \"And what do you know of such things?\"  Again, Legolas paused before answering. \"I know that when grieving, a Dwarf is succored by his brothers, sisters, parents, and children, if they are able. But if they are unable, or if the Dwarf finds himself without kin, then he grieves alone.\" The sound of supple leather moving upon rock came to Gimli's ears, a reminder that Legolas could never fully silence his footfalls upon stone. That he could not blend with the rock as he could with the forest. \"Again, perhaps I am too bold,\" Legolas said, his voice closer now. \"I am not family, and I am certainly no Dwarf. But if you would allow it, I would mourn Gl\u00f3in with you.\"  A tentative hand came to rest upon Gimli's shoulder, and he could feel the tension that laced the grip. But the tension in Gimli's own body eased, and before he knew what he was doing, he reached up and clasped the Elf's hand tightly. It was true that Legolas was neither Dwarf nor kin, but in Gimli's mind, the Elf's friendship had earned him a privilege almost never granted to those outside the dwarven race. \"My thanks,\" Gimli whispered, and his voice shook. \"I would be greatly comforted.\"  In silence, Gimli had mourned Gandalf the Grey. In silence, he had mourned Boromir. In silence he had mourned Balin, \u00d3in, and Ori. But in great, choking sobs, he mourned his father, and as he crumpled to the ground, Legolas knelt with him, holding him fast in arms that did not yield.    It was Otin, Gimli ' s chief architect, who first noticed the trickle of dirt streaming down the Thrihyrne. Gimli was not surprised; Otin seemed to constantly look for such things. Together, the two found the rowan tree to be responsible. Its roots had opened large cracks in the mountain, and parts of the rock were now breaking off and mixing with windblown soil. Additional wear from water and ice had created even more cracks to hold this soil, and Gimli ' s thoughts went back to the legend that Legolas had shared concerning the first rowan tree. By contrast, Otin wondered\u2014rather loudly\u2014if rock crumbling into soil was a good thing. Gimli smiled at him and pointed out that soil could bring forth life. Otin answered with dark mutterings about stability and support, but said little else.     Climbing the rowan trail after sundown while inebriated was not the wisest thing Gimli had ever done. Some part of him recognized this, but this same part also recognized that the rest of Gimli would not realize his predicament until the following morning when he would be faced with both a downward climb and a pounding headache. So this small part of him kept quiet and watched with bemusement as the world spun away in dizzying but pleasant circles.  \"To the lances of Rohan and the strength of the Dwarves!\" Legolas cried, raising the wineskin that he had spirited away from the festivities.  Gimli grinned and raised his own stolen flagon of ale. \"To the swords of Gondor and the bows of the Elves!\" he returned.  They both drank deeply, and below them, the singing and merriment of Helm's Deep rang throughout the canyons. The Westfold was safe again from the threat of a Dunland invasion and probably would be for many years given Dunland's grievous losses in the battles against Rohan and Aglarond. The added force of an elven and mannish contingent from Gondor only served to strengthen the message that Dunland's raiding would not be tolerated.  \"We should have done this long ago,\" Gimli mused, staring into his ale.  Legolas blinked at him. \"We did. It has been nigh unto thirty years since we planted the rowan, and we have often climbed to this ledge since then.\"  \"No! I meant Dunland. We should not have waited so long to attack.\"  \"Their raiding was hard to discern,\" Legolas pointed out. \"It required the bulk of the past year to prove that it was indeed Dunland who was responsible and not brigands in the hills.\"  Gimli grunted, feeling a bit too drunk to argue. Instead, he moved toward the edge of the rocky shelf and looked down upon Helm's Deep, smiling at the lights and the music. \"A dance is underway,\" he observed.  Legolas joined him on the ledge, his legs not as steady as usual. \"And a stirring dance it is. I know of few others who can celebrate as the Rohirrim can.\"  \"What of the Elves?\"  \"If you speak of the woodland folk, then they would be among the few,\" Legolas said airily.  Gimli raised his brow at that, placed the flagon against his lips, and took a long, noisy drink.  \"Gimli!\"  The Dwarf smiled and tottered away from the edge, moving toward the rowan tree. \"How can the Elves claim to be such a festive folk if they cannot endure a little slurping?\" he asked, sitting down and leaning against the tree's trunk.  \"Because we do not include slurping in our festivities,\" Legolas answered, following Gimli and easing down next to him.  \"And yet you claim there is just as much celebration,\" Gimli shook his head. \"I do not believe this to be possible.\"  \"Then I will have to educate you,\" Legolas said, taking a long\u2014and silent\u2014drink from his wineskin before tipping his head back against the rowan.  Gimli waited a moment. \"I am not impressed,\" he said at length.  \"I am not educating you  now !\" Legolas answered, his voice sleepy. \"The grandeur of my people's celebrations might cast aspersions on the celebration now enjoyed by the Rohirrim.\"  \"How very noble of you,\" Gimli said, doing his drunken best to make certain that there was plenty of sarcasm in his tone. They said nothing more for a time, drinking occasionally and listening to the sounds of laughter and joy drifting up from the party below. The voices of Men, Elves, and Dwarves could all be heard, and Gimli smiled at that until a strange and somewhat disturbing thought came to him. He frowned, struggling to sift this thought with a mind slowed by ale. \"Legolas?\"  \"Yes?\"  \"Why are we not down there with them?\"  The Elf had closed his eyes, but he opened them now and his brow furrowed. \"Do you wish to descend?\"  Gimli considered the question. \"No,\" he said, and some of his mind cleared as concern edged its way in. \"Should I?\"  Legolas shook his head. \"I do not know.\"  \"Do you wish to descend?\"  Again, the Elf shook his head. \"No. I am content here, and the wind is crisp tonight. It is enough.\"  They were silent after that, each lost in thought. Gimli felt that there was some significance to the fact that they had abandoned the party in favor of their ledge beneath the rowan tree, but his sluggish mind could not forge an answer to the puzzle. Eventually, his eyes closed and he began to doze. Strong canyon winds were beginning to blow, and the rustling of the rowan tree lulled him further. Then another voice joined the sound of wind and rowan, and Gimli slipped further away as Legolas began to sing a low, whispering song.  But just before dreams overtook him completely, a part of Gimli's mind translated some of the elven song and came up with the word for \"Sea.\"    Not many years after noting the trickle of dirt, Otin noted that the tree seemed to be knotting and twisting in a strange fashion. Once this was brought to his attention, Gimli marveled that neither he nor Legolas had seen it earlier. It was a slow process, but its effects were beginning to show in the distortion of branches and the tight curl of creeping roots. The clefts in the rock made by those roots grew too wide to hold the dirt that collected around the tree, and the trickle down the mountainside grew larger. When Legolas next came to visit, Gimli showed him the problem, but the Elf had no solution. He merely stated that he had not expected the tree to grow so large so quickly and that he hoped it would be able to withstand its own strength. Gimli hoped so, also, for he had begun to sense that the rock around the rowan was becoming unstable.    A Dwarf's two hundredth birthday was a day of great rejoicing. It marked the Dwarf's advancement to the status of an Elder, a rank traditionally entitled to respect, renown, and a theoretical absence of criticism from younger Dwarves. That last benefit was not always realized; Gimli himself had often questioned the Elders when it came to various political matters, and given his friendship with a certain Elf, he had no doubt but what he would receive similar treatment from the growing number of more suspiciously minded youth.  But that did not mean that his two hundredth year mark would be anything less than a spectacular event. Pippin, one of many visitors who joined Gimli for the occasion, termed it a \"party of special magnificence that  dwarfed \"\u2014said with a cheeky grin that drew a groan from Merry\u2014\"even Bilbo's eleventy-first birthday.\" Which was high praise coming from a Hobbit, though in truth, Gimli himself was impressed: Cooks throughout the Westfold had turned out a feast the likes of which satisfied even Shire appetites. Guests had arrived from across Middle-earth and filled Helm's Deep to the point where additional lodging was set up in the Deeping Coomb. And the Dwarves had demonstrated the fruits of their efforts to understand Orthanc Fire, putting together a fireworks display that might have amazed even Gandalf.  Yet for all its splendor and all its excitement, Gimli could not quite shake the feeling that something was\u2026wrong.  He said nothing about this strange feeling, though, and went about the business of having an extravagant birthday. Music, dancing, and feasting lasted all day and well into the night. Rosie and Sam were among the many who simply fell asleep at their tables. Aragorn and Eldarion were among the few who managed to stumble off to their quarters before succumbing to exhaustion. But as for Gimli, he found himself increasingly unsettled, and sleep was far from his mind.  \"Still awake?\" a drunken voice demanded. \"We thought you had taken yourself to bed hours ago!\"  \"And miss my own celebration, Otin?\" Gimli answered, clapping his friend on the shoulder. \"Never! But perhaps you should take your own counsel. You do not look as though you could tunnel your way out of sand.\"  \"Nonsense,\" Otin huffed. \"But it was not counsel I offered. It was an observation. We have missed you at the tables. Dwalin rolled out several more barrels of drink!\"  \"And how many of you should I expect to see before the noon hour tomorrow?\" Gimli wondered.  Otin grinned. \"It may be a quiet morning. But come! There is still drink left, and some of our kindred are gathering for tales.\"  \"In a moment, perhaps,\" Gimli said, looking around at the many tables arrayed behind the Deeping Wall. \"Have you seen Legolas? I thought he had come down to the courtyard, but perhaps I was mistaken.\"  A look that might have been disapproval crossed Otin's face, but it was quickly hidden. \"I saw him not long ago. He told me that he was climbing the trail to the tree.\"  Gimli nodded, thinking he should have expected no less. There had probably been too much slurping in the Hornburg for Legolas's tastes. \"Did he say anything else?\"  This time, Otin's expression reflected confusion. \"Yes. He said that the wind is crisp tonight.\" Otin made a show of looking at the banners and pennants atop the walls, all of which hung motionless. \"Elven nonsense, I thought it.\"  But Gimli closed his eyes at the words and groaned. \"Elven nonsense, indeed,\" he sighed, \"but not of the kind you think.\" And with that, he turned away, heading for the mountain trail.  \"Gimli?\" Otin called after him. \"Will you not join us?\"  \"Perhaps another time,\" Gimli answered, and then he put aside all thoughts of celebration in order to concentrate on the matter at hand. His feeling that something was wrong suddenly made sense.   The wind is crisp tonight.   It had taken Gimli some time to recognize, but after many years of watching and listening, he had learned that when Legolas felt the pull of the Sea, he frequently spoke of the wind. He did this most often when he did not wish to burden others with his Sea-longing, and those times when he was least subtle\u2014such as when he referred to an absent wind\u2014were those times when he felt the longing most keenly. Gimli still did not understand this strange affliction, but at least now, he knew how to combat it.  \"Gimli?\"  Arriving at the top of the trail and pausing a moment to catch his breath, Gimli's sharp eyes searched the darkness and quickly spied the shadow of a figure seated beneath the rowan. \"Legolas,\" he greeted.  \"I did not expect to see you here,\" the Elf said, and his tone was distant.  \"As an Elder Dwarf, I am allowed to be unexpected,\" Gimli answered. He moved toward the Elf and ducked beneath the rowan's lower branches, nudging Legolas aside so that he could sit with his back against the trunk of the tree.  \"It is peaceful here,\" Legolas observed.  Gimli had been wracking his brain for a good distraction from the Sea-longing, and seeing an opportunity in these words, he gave an indignant sniff and said, \"By which you mean that my celebration is  not  a peaceful affair?\"  His tactic worked well, surprising a laugh out of Legolas. \"Peaceful? Most assuredly not! Indeed, I recant every word I ever said in praise of the Rohirrim's ability to celebrate, or even my own people's. This gathering of yours puts all other gatherings to shame. I fear it will be months ere the good people of the Westfold Vale recover from this event!\"  \"Months?\" Gimli echoed, deciding to take the distraction one step further. \"Loth\u00edriel felt they would need only a week.\"  Legolas laughed again. \"Loth\u00edriel sought her bed earlier than did many others. She did not see Eomer and Elfwine engaging in a contest of drinks. Nor did she see the rest of Helm's Deep joining in.\"  Now it was Gimli's turn to laugh. \"Otin believes that only a few will see the morning sun. The rest will wake to find it already in the western sky.\"  \"I do not doubt it,\" Legolas said. There was a pause and then, \"He asked after you.\"  Gimli blinked. \"Who?\"  \"Otin.\"  Gimli's brow furrowed. \"I spoke with him just ere I found you. He said nothing of needing me.\"  Legolas turned his head, and beneath the glow of starlight, his eyes gleamed. \"Then what did he say?\"  \"He asked if I wished to join him for tales.\"  \"That, my friend, was why he wished to speak to you.\"  Wondering if he had indulged in too much drink to follow this conversation, Gimli rubbed his temples. \"He needed me to join him in listening to tales?\"  The Elf hesitated. \"No. Say, rather, that he wished for you to join your kindred. Gimli\u2026\" Legolas trailed off, looking unsure of his next words. \"Not all of your people respect the keenness of my ears, and I have heard murmurs this night. Murmurs that you spend more time with your guests than you do with your people.\"  Gimli frowned at that and immediately began to deny the accusation. A Dwarf's two hundredth birthday was, after all, very much a matter of his status amongst his kindred. But then he stopped, thinking through the day's events, and much to his surprise, he found he could not refute the murmurs. They were true. They were true, and he had not realized it. Nor had he recognized the strange looks this had prompted from the other Dwarves. Perhaps there was more to his sense that something was wrong than just an Elf feeling the call of the Sea.  \"My apologies,\" Legolas murmured. \"I did not wish to burden you with insult.\"  \"You did not,\" Gimli said, wondering how he could have acted so during such a momentous step in a Dwarf's life. And yet, how could he have acted otherwise? His ties to friends among his kindred were no longer as strong as his ties to friends among Elves, Men, and Hobbits. And in the case of one particular tie, whose eyes seemed to be growing distant yet again\u2026 \"Legolas!\"  The Elf shook his head sharply. \"Again, my apologies. I fear I am poor company. The wind\u2026\" He stopped, as though suddenly remembering that Gimli now understood.  \"I know,\" Gimli sighed. \"The wind is crisp tonight.\"  \"Yes,\" Legolas whispered.  There could be only one response to that, and as silence fell between them, Gimli began to hum. It was an old dwarven tune that spoke of earth and deeps. Of foundations and heritage and all the things to which Dwarves clung fast. In this, at least, Gimli still followed his people's traditions. He still knew their songs, for he sung them frequently. The irony was that Legolas also knew the dwarven songs, for he was the one to whom Gimli most often sang. Gimli's kindred feared that that his friendships outside the dwarven realms were enticing him to leave behind the traditions and legacy that bolstered dwarven hearts, but it was Legolas who forced him to remember his heritage. For it was this heritage from which Legolas drew strength to deny the Sea-longing.  And as he continued to hum, Gimli heard the Elf's light tenor join in, adding a lilting counterpoint to the music of rock and stone.    During the early years of King Elfwine ' s reign, the ledge beneath the rowan tree collapsed. This time, Gimli did not need Otin to alert him to the situation, for Gimli had been standing on the ledge when it gave way. Only by catching hold of the roots that now extended out of the rock did Gimli prevent a fall that would have ended his life. When he was finally pulled to safety, Otin pointed out that he had warned Gimli of impending instability. Gimli said nothing, for he had also been aware of the cracks growing within the rock. He had simply hoped, as Legolas had hoped, that it would be able to withstand its own strength and weight.     It had not.    \"What compelled you to step out onto that\u2026I do not even know if it can still be called a ledge!\" Legolas exclaimed, his voice laced with anger.  Refusing to be intimidated, Gimli folded his arms and regarded the cliff beneath the rowan that at one point had been a rocky shelf. \"It seemed safe enough at the time. And it could still be called a ledge when last I walked on it.\"  \"It was nearly the last you walked on anything!\"  \"If I had known it was going to collapse, I\u2014\"  \"You are a Dwarf!\" Legolas interrupted heatedly. \"Is it not in your nature to anticipate such a collapse?\"  Gimli sighed. He had endured a very similar conversation with Otin, though Otin had not waited for Gimli to be pulled back onto safer ground before starting his lecture. While dangling from first the rowan and then a rope, Gimli had been forced to suffer through an enraged recitation of basic safety instructions so rudimentary they could be recited by every beardless youth from the Iron Hills to the Blue Mountains. \"My mind was elsewhere that day,\" he told Legolas.  Unfortunately, the excuse bore as much weight with Legolas as it had with Otin. \"You could have fallen to your death! If the roots you clung to had given way\u2014\"  \"But they did not give way,\" Gimli pointed out, struggling to keep his voice calm in the face of the other's anger. \"I am yet here. The tree is yet here. The only thing that seems to have suffered from the incident is the ledge itself, and that is no great loss. The view is as good from here as it was further on.\" The set of Legolas's jaw told Gimli that the Elf was still upset, but at least he was no longer shouting. That was progress. \"So tell me of Dale's trade council,\" he said.  \"There was much talk of trade,\" came the curt response.  Gimli sighed. \"I am sorry I was on the ledge when it gave way. If it eases your mind, I cannot repeat my actions. There is no more ledge to stand upon.\" He watched Legolas closely as he spoke, and though the Elf's eyes were still hard, a smile seemed to twitch at the corners of his lips. Gimli took that as a good sign. \"Now then,\" he continued, patting his pockets in the hopes of finding his pipe. \"What else can you tell me of the trade council? Or is elven memory too burdened to remember such things?\"  \"There is naught wrong with my memory,\" Legolas muttered.  Gimli raised his brow at that. \"No? Who was it that suffered a sudden fit of forgetfulness when Thranduil demanded to know why there seemed to be a barrel of Dorwinion missing from the last trade council?\"  The anger faded from Legolas's face, and his smile grew as he shook his head. \"You were missed, my friend.\"  \"I anticipated as much,\" Gimli said loftily, earning himself an exasperated look. \"But that only tells me what you and others missed. I would know what  I  missed.\"  \"You apparently did not miss much in the way of excitement, for you were quite adept at making your own,\" Legolas said, looking at the remnants of the rocky ledge.  \"I have admitted my foolishness already!\" Gimli said, finding his pipe and moving on to search for Longbottom Leaf. \"Now tell me of the council!\"  \"Surely your merchants reported their dealings.\"  \"And that is all they reported. I would hear what arrangements others negotiated. In particular, I would hear what concessions Thranduil made so as to ensure a steady supply of Dorwinion's wine.\"  Legolas laughed. \"Dorwinion's new trade minister is well aware of how much Greenwood enjoys that wine. The concessions were costly.\" He paused, and his head canted to one side. \"I propose an exchange.\"  \"I thought our exchanges were dealt with at the council,\" Gimli said absently, wondering if he had left his pipe-weed in his other belt pouch.  \"Even so, I would add one more: I will give you a full accounting of the trade council in Dale if you give me the true reason for your absence.\"  Gimli froze, his quest for pipe-weed forgotten. \"Did I not send a missive explaining my absence?\" he asked, not daring to meet the Elf's eyes.  \"Your chief merchant explained that you were needed here.\"  \"And so I was.\"  \"Why?\"  Gimli twisted the empty pipe in his hands. \"There was a mistake involving the gate that Elfwine commissioned. I was needed to speedily make other arrangements.\"  \"And Otin could not have handled these other arrangements?\"  \"It was swifter and easier if we both did.\"  The feel of a penetrating elven stare seared its way into Gimli's mind, pulling his eyes upward until they were seized by an iron gaze that refused to release its prey. \"The true reason, Gimli,\" Legolas said, his voice low and commanding. \"Why did you not come to Dale?\"  Gimli's jaw tightened, and for a moment, he considered insisting that Meduseld's gate was the only obstacle. But Legolas was convinced otherwise, and Legolas was probably one of the few who would understand the true reason. Unfortunately, a significant portion of that understanding would be due to the fact that Legolas was part of that reason.  \"Would it aid your honesty to know that your dwarven merchants are not as careful in their speech as you might want them to be? And that they still do not respect the keenness of my ears?\"  The words were softly spoken, but beneath them, the tone was laced with steel. With effort, Gimli broke away from Legolas's gaze and closed his eyes. \"How much do you know already?\"  \"I know that your traders were able to negotiate better prices from the Lonely Mountain this year. I know that the same holds true for your arrangements with the Iron Hills. And I know that many Dwarves openly friendly to my own folk in Ithilien were absent from the council.\"  Gimli's jaw clenched, and one hand came up to rub his brow. \"It was not my will to send such a delegation, but I have not the power I once did. Many of the younger merchants voted against me, and I could not gainsay their wishes. Nor could I oppose them in this. Not when they are right.\"  \"About what are they right?\"  \"That if we wish to trade with our own people, we must be seen to favor them. The Dwarves are dwindling, Legolas. There are so few of us now. Some have even spoken of sealing our halls to all outsiders. It is felt that the world of Men erodes our heritage, and as our heritage erodes, so do we. Dwarves do not endure change easily, and there is now great suspicion amongst the younger generation. They cling to the old traditions. The old alliances. The old enemies.\"  \"Is this also how you feel?\"  Unable to read the tone in the other's voice, Gimli opened his eyes and sneaked a glance at Legolas. But the Elf was no longer watching him. Rather, his gaze had turned north and east, and he had a look about him that said his thoughts were flowing south along the rivers. \"The Dwarves are not the people we once were,\" Gimli confessed softly. \"This I know, and this I have known for many years. But I do not believe it to be the work of Men or Elves or any other creature that walks beneath the sun. Rather, I think our time nears its end.\"  \"Then we are of an accord,\" Legolas murmured, \"for I feel as you do. The Elves are both dwindling and fading, few in number and reluctant in spirit. And it is thought by some that avoiding the influence of Men might slow our decline. Had my father not requested my presence, I do not think my own advisors would have allowed me to attend the council.\" He was silent for a moment and then, almost as an afterthought, added, \"There were some in Minas Tirith who were also against my going.\"  Gimli blinked at that. \"Why?\"  \"I represent too many competing interests. Do I speak for Ithilien? And if so, do I speak for the Elves or for Faramir? Or perhaps, as a friend of the King, I speak for Gondor. Or for Greenwood. Or for Thranduil. Or even for you.\"  That sparked a bristle on Gimli's part. \"You have never spoken for me!\"  Legolas raised a brow. \"We stand together on many disputed matters.\"  \"Yes, on matters that are of mutual interest to both Ithilien and Aglarond!\" Gimli returned heatedly.  \"On some matters, yes. On others\u2026\" Legolas shook his head. \"There are whisperings that perhaps you unduly influence me. That when I speak, I but convey the will of the Dwarves.\"  Gimli stared at him. \"Have any of these whisperers been privy to one of our arguments?\"  A smile ghosted across Legolas's face. \"I can only assume that they have not. Nevertheless, they petitioned Aragorn to find some task that would keep me in Gondor. He refused them, but he is also aware of the dwindling Dwarves and fading Elves.\"  \"And what has he to say on the matter?\"  \"He is undecided. There is strength in our unity, but there is merit in the argument that perhaps it would be easier if those attending future trade councils were truer representatives of their realms.\" Legolas shook his head, his face sober. \"Many of my people are beginning to agree with this view. Some even believe that we should restrict our associations with Men, Dwarves, and Hobbits, and I fear there is little I can do to convince them otherwise. We are fading quickly, and as Imrahil was wont to say, one does not fight the tide.\"  \"And if this tide should ask that you sever your ties with others altogether?\" Gimli demanded, alarmed by both his friend's resignation and the reference to the Sea. \"Would you seek to appease it in all things?\"  \"No,\" Legolas said softly, \"I would not.\" His eyes darkened. \"But my realm might.\"  Gimli felt his heart sink somewhere into his stomach, yet at the same time, his will hardened. \"Then we must be stronger than our people,\" he vowed solemnly.  Legolas's expression seemed weary, and he looked at Gimli for a long moment before bending down and scooping up a handful of dirt that had once been rock. \"Even strength cannot outlast time.\"  To that, Gimli had no answer.    The rowan continued to grow, but it was now a strange and gnarled thing. It clung to the mountain even as it destroyed the rock, and though the rock sought to provide it with soil, the flow of dirt down into Helm ' s Deep ensured that the tree had less and less mountain to cling to. The rowan ' s years were coming to a close, and with despair, Gimli realized that there was naught he could do to save it.    Faramir's death came shortly after the aging King Elfwine asked for a new arrangement with regards to Ithilien's annual purchase of Rohirrim horses. The funeral brought the negotiations to a halt, but afterward, Legolas volunteered to travel to Rohan and renew the talks on Ithilien's behalf, thereby giving Elboron a chance to better acquaint himself with the duties charged to the Steward of Gondor. Gimli merely shook his head when this news reached him. Elboron knew very well what was expected of the Steward and had been taking on a fair number of the Steward's duties in recent years.  But Legolas's arrival in Rohan meant that Gimli did not have to seek him out in Ithilien, which made the Dwarf's task easier. Trusting Otin with the management of Aglarond, Gimli saddled a pony and went to Edoras. He said very little during his stay, but when the negotiations were concluded, he invited Legolas to return with him to Helm's Deep. They arrived late in the evening, and Legolas immediately went to his chambers, claiming weariness from a long journey. Gimli let him go, but after he retired to his own rooms, he kept watch by his windows until sometime in the early morning, he spied a glimmer of gold on the trail to the rowan tree.  The guards at Aglarond's entrance gave him a pair of sidelong looks as he left the caves, but Gimli did not pause to glare them into submission. Their skeptical eyes would watch him with or without his censure. Besides, he had not the time for such trivialities. A mournful Elf awaited his presence, and mournful Elves did not wait patiently.  He made no secret of his coming. It had been many years since he had last caught Legolas unawares. But though his footsteps were surely a loud plod of sturdy boots up a rocky incline, when he reached the top, Legolas gave no sign that he knew of Gimli's presence.  Gimli was not surprised. He had succored Legolas in grief before and knew the battle that lay before him. \"Legolas,\" he said quietly.  The Elf stiffened but made no other movement. \"I do not wish for company,\" he said, his voice filled with an ageless, elven fury that might cause even Aragorn to pause.  Fortunately, Gimli was not Aragorn. \"Perhaps you do not wish for others' company,\" he said, \"but I know that you wish for mine.\"  Legolas turned his head at that, his eyes dark and flinty. \"You presume much.\"  \"Nay, I do not. In fact, I presume very little. If you had no wish for my company, you would not have come to Rohan. You would not have come to Aglarond. And you would not have climbed the trail to the rowan,\" Gimli reasoned, forcing himself to meet Legolas's burning gaze. He had weathered his share of elven glares, but when Legolas mourned, it was as if all that Gimli had learned in enduring such looks was forgotten.  \"I came to Rohan out of duty. I came to Aglarond at your request.\"  \"And coming to the rowan tree?\" Gimli asked.  The Elf's eyes narrowed. \"I wished to hear the wind.\"  The words were spoken knowing that Gimli understood their significance. That he understood the reference to the Sea-longing and Legolas's growing desire to answer it. The words were intended to hurt, and they did. They hurt very much, but Gimli was anchored by the knowledge that the harder Legolas fought, the greater his need. \"And what does the wind say to you?\" he asked Legolas.  Something flickered in Legolas's stormy eyes. Something hurt and bewildered, and Gimli was reminded that Legolas did not understand death. At least, not death by aging. Death by battle was a much easier concept. Every Elf understood that, for elven history was riddled with it. Elves had fought terrible wars against armies of Balrogs, Dragons, Orcs, and even other Elves. The shadow of first Morgoth and then Sauron had ensured that the Elves had seen more death in battle than any other race, and they understood all too well the horrors that could be summoned by sword, spear, and grief. But  mortal  death was a puzzle. The idea that a body could simply waste away, struck down by nothing save the forces of time\u2026 To them, it was a maddening notion.  \"Legolas?\" Gimli prompted gently, knowing that the Elf was near his breaking point. \"Faramir would not wish you to bear this alone.\"  Faramir's name seemed to spark something. There was a flash in the back of Legolas's eyes, and for a moment, it seemed as though all of Arda stood still. The wind faded. The stars dimmed. The night withdrew until a Dwarf and an Elf were all that remained. Then Legolas's breath caught. Cracks appeared in his hard gaze, and the cracks widened rapidly. Bursting forth from these cracks, the power of his grief overcame him, and he fell to his knees, trembling beneath its weight.  Gimli stood ready to catch him.  \"They are leaving,\" Legolas hissed, his hands seizing Gimli's arms in a bruising grip. \"All of them! The harder I grasp, the faster they slip away!\"  Gimli shut his eyes and tightened his hold on Legolas, forcing himself to remain strong. Legolas was not the only one who mourned Faramir's passing, but for Legolas, the grief was harder. The bond between Steward and Elf had been strong. Together, they had pooled their efforts into making Ithilien a realm that was both forest and garden. Together, they had counseled. Together, they had traveled. And together, they had fought hard in Gondor's defense. Theirs was a friendship forged over long years by both fire and peace, and the sundering of this friendship now caused Legolas to shudder violently in Gimli's arms.  Yet even as Gimli struggled to bury his own grief, he could not help but remember other losses: Imrahil. Eowyn. Erkenbrand. Elfhelm. Loth\u00edriel. Merry. Pippin. Samwise. Eomer\u2026  That last had been particularly difficult, for Eomer and Gimli had crafted a friendship not unlike the one between Legolas and Faramir. Even now, Gimli had no clear memory of the dark days that followed Eomer's death. He knew only that in the end, Legolas had come. And much as he now sought to be strong for Legolas, Legolas had been strong for him. Legolas had carved for himself his own rules when it came to grief. Dwarves tended to suffer alone, but Legolas refused to allow that and had comforted and consoled Gimli for many days, at times offering words but more often offering his silent presence.  Gimli could do no less in return.  So they huddled together upon the mountainside, tears drying in the wind, and mourned for those whom they had loved as brothers. The night passed, morning came, and still they did not move. Legolas's grief ran deep, and his strength failed him. At length, exhausted and spent, he allowed Gimli to prop him against the mountainside, and then Gimli sat next to him, one hand upon Legolas's shoulder as the Dwarf both watched and kept watch while the sun rose high into the sky.  \"My thanks,  elvellon ,\" Legolas whispered, his eyes closed and his face pale.  Gimli shifted, his thoughts troubled, and he wondered over something he wished to ask. It was not an easy question, but he and Legolas had endured too much for difficult matters to be silenced between them. And in spite of their recent loss\u2014and also because of it\u2014Gimli could not forbear. \"You never answered me earlier,\" he said.  Legolas shifted slightly. \"Regarding?\"  \"The wind. What does it say to you?\"  At that, Legolas opened his eyes and looked at Gimli, his gaze weary and troubled. \"Why do you ask me this?\"  \"Because I must,\" Gimli said, squeezing the Elf's shoulder. \"It is stronger now, is it not? With every loss, the call becomes clearer. What does it say? What is it you hear?\"  There was a long pause, and Legolas turned his face toward the sun. \"The gulls,\" he finally murmured, apparently too tired to evade the Dwarf's question. \"The surf. And\u2026a home. A home where I would be welcomed.\"  Gimli looked away, his own eyes straying toward the entrance to Aglarond. And at long last, he felt he understood. Not completely. Not yet. But he had now an inkling of what the Sea-longing meant to Legolas. And when Legolas began to hum a song of the tide, Gimli hesitated only a moment before quietly joining in.    Neither Gimli nor Legolas was present for the tree ' s death. They had been called away by another ' s death and were with Aragorn as he marked his final days. As for the tree, it perished during a fierce storm amidst rain that pounded as hammers against the mountains and winds that threatened to tear the Deeping Coomb asunder. Lightning was the tree ' s bane, and with one terrible strike, it ripped the rowan loose and flung it to the base of the Thrihyrne in a cascade of gravel and rock. With the help of others, Otin took it and set it aside, guarding it so that one who did not know its history could not mistake it for firewood. When Gimli at last returned from Minas Tirith, Legolas accompanied him, leaving all governance of Ithilien to Elboron, and together Elf and Dwarf buried the rowan at the base of the mountains. Few marked the occasion, for few now marked the rowan ' s significance. But those who did remember sensed that a change had come\u2026    \"It was a good tree,\" Gimli said.  He and Legolas had climbed the trail to view the site where the rowan had once grown. A light rain was falling, but it was not heavy enough to make the journey dangerous, and Legolas felt that the storm would grow no worse.  The Elf stirred at his side. \"A century ago, I would have laughed to hear you say that.\"  Gimli smiled. \"A century ago, I would not have said it. But it was a good tree. It grew for many years and in a difficult place.\" His smile faded, and he tugged at his beard. \"Will you return to Ithilien now?\"  A pause. \"Where else would I go?\"  Gimli's jaw clenched. \"I would rather learn that answer from you than from the wind.\"  The sound that came from Legolas was somewhere between a hiss and a sigh, barely audible over the drum of rain. \"I do not wish to speak of the wind.\"  \"Then it must be a strong wind.\"  A prickling sensation crept over Gimli's skin. Had he not recognized the source as elven anger, he might have feared a lightning strike. \"Why do you press this?\" Legolas asked, his voice low and ragged. \"Can we not stand here and mourn Aragorn as we have mourned others? Why must we talk of the Sea?\"  \" We  do not talk of the Sea,\" Gimli said, struggling to remain calm. \" I  talk of the Sea. You have said nothing of either the Sea or the wind for nearly forty years. The last you spoke of it was shortly after Faramir's death.\"  \"And we must make this a tradition?\" Legolas demanded, his eyes flashing. \"When grief assails us, we must now talk of the Sea?\"  \"No! We must talk of the Sea because its call has become so loud that when you turn your mind to it, you are deaf to all else!\"  \"And you wish to subject me to that?\" Both outrage and betrayal laced the Elf's voice, and his eyes were so dark that they were almost black. \"Why? Why would you\u2014\"  \"Because I have no wish to mourn  you !\" Gimli snapped, his patience gone. \"Because I refuse to stand quietly by and watch as you destroy yourself in resisting what is no longer a choice!\"  \"And who are you to decide that this is no longer a choice?\" Legolas returned, his hands balling into fists at his side. \"If I continue to refuse the Sea's call, then it is very much a choice!\"  \"Why would you make such a choice?\"  Legolas raised his brow, raindrops trickling down the sides of his face. \"Have you an honest need to ask that question?\"  \"Yes!\"  Legolas uttered a sharp oath and looked away. \"Over a century ago, I told you that there were a handful of mortals who would surely come to grief without me. Of those mortals, a certain Dwarf yet lives, and for him, I would tarry a while longer.\"  Had the situation not been so grim, Gimli would have smiled. \"It is because of me that you tarry?\"  The answer was quiet but firm. \"Yes.\"  Gimli nodded, both pleased and grieved with himself. \"Then in truth, you have no choice, for you have given the choice to me.\"  Legolas's head snapped back toward the Dwarf, water flying from his hair.  \"You have just made me responsible for your presence in Middle-earth,\" Gimli continued before Legolas could say aught. \"And if death or madness takes you because you do not sail, then the blame will rest upon my shoulders. Thus I claim the right to refuse that blame, and I say the time for choosing is past!\"  \"Speak, then!\" Legolas challenged angrily. \"What do  you  choose?\"  Taking a deep breath, Gimli mustered all the resolve he could. His heart shattered and his voice cracked, but his words were filled with conviction. \"You must depart,\" he answered. \"You must heed the call.\"  Legolas's face went ashen. \"Is that truly your wish?\"  Gimli clung to his resolve tightly. \"Yes. Consider what Aragorn's death is doing to you: You do not eat. You do not sleep. Your hands shake and your voices trembles. I doubt you could bring your bow to a full draw! And much of the time, it as though you do not even recognize where you are or how you came to be there! You lament the dwindling Elves but fail to see how your own spirit fades! Now consider how desperately you wish to give yourself to the Sea. Think you that you can endure its voice? In your condition? I know you, Legolas. I know your limits, and this is beyond them!\"  The Elf's face became hard. \"Then it seems you still have much to learn.\"  \"I have learned enough!\" Gimli shot back, refusing to be dissuaded. \"I have learned the power of your grief. I have learned that every time a loved one dies, a part of you dies with them. I have learned that you now spend a good portion of your morning watching the gulls above Ithilien. I have learned that Ithilien itself dwindles. I have learned that the Sea whispers of home and welcome. I have learned that you once built a ship in Dol Amroth. And I have learned that this ship is yet in their harbor!\"  Legolas took a step backwards. \"How did you\u2026 Only Imrahil and the shipmasters knew of\u2014\"  \"Prince Elphir once spoke of it to Eomer.\"  His gaze distant, Legolas smiled slightly. \"I marvel that it still floats.\"  \"They have cared for it and repaired it as needed,\" Gimli told him.  Blinking, the Elf shook his head, his eyes becoming sharp. \"It matters not. That ship is too small to sail beyond the harbor. When I sail, I will need to build another ship.\"  \"Then by all the forges of Mahal, build one!\" Gimli roared. \"This cannot continue, Legolas!\"  \"Gimli\u2026\"  \"If I am the reason you tarry, then I can also be the reason you leave!\"  \"Gimli\u2014\"  \"And I say to you that you  must  leave! I will not have your blood on my hands! You cannot ask that of me!\"  \"Gimli\u2014\"  \"Durin's anvil, you are a stiff-necked elven fool to even think to ask that of me! It would be as if\u2014\"  \" Gimli !\"  Legolas's shout was so loud that it thundered through the rain and across the mountains, echoing between the canyon walls until all of Arda seemed to be calling the Dwarf's name. Both Legolas and Gimli froze, taken aback by the power of the Elf's outburst, and for a moment, neither could move. Legolas was the first to recover, and when he spoke, his voice was soft but unyielding. \"Gimli. I will not leave you alone in Middle-earth.\"  Blast the Elf, could he not see the danger? Could he not see the risk to himself? Gimli's voice now took on a frantic edge. \"I am hardly alone here! I have Aglarond. I have my family and my\u2014\"  \"No, Gimli. You do not. There was a time years ago when this was true, but it is true no longer. You are a stranger to them.\"  Rage boiled through Gimli's blood. A stranger? To his own kin? But even as his anger surged, the cold voice of fact cooled his heart. Legolas was right. The Dwarves still listened to him, and to an extent, they still respected him. But they were a failing people, and in defiance of this, they were stepping away from the world around them. And in so doing, they were also stepping away from Gimli, for he could not follow. In a sense, both he and Legolas had become things of the past, clinging to a friendship that had outlived its time.  And with this realization came a solution. A strange and curious solution, the very thought of which made Gimli's stomach knot with uncertainty. But it was a solution, nonetheless, and Gimli was just desperate enough to suggest it. \"Then take me with you.\"  Legolas blinked. \"What?\"  \"Take me with you. If you will not depart while I remain, then so be it. Sail, and I will sail also.\"  \"Gimli, I\u2014\"  \"Frodo sailed,\" Gimli said, raising his voice over Legolas's objection. \"Bilbo sailed. Sam sailed. Can I not do likewise?\"  \"No! Gimli, they were granted special leave to sail. They were Ring-bearers!\"  \"And I am an Elf-friend!\"  \"That is hardly\u2026\" Legolas trailed off, his jaw clenching. \"The laws of the\u2014\"  \"What have we to lose?\" Gimli demanded. \"What would be the consequence?\"  \"Death,\" Legolas snapped. \"For both of us.\"  \"And the consequence if we do not sail? Death. Again, for both of us. Legolas, you will not endure if you do not sail now. Either your body or your mind will fail. And I am mortal. In the end, there is nothing that will prevent my death. So let us challenge fate on our terms and put our trust in this one, last hope. A fool's hope, perhaps, but we have been fools before. What say you, Legolas? Shall we sail?\"  Legolas stared at him. For a moment and an age, Legolas did nothing more than stare. Gimli held his peace, wrestling with the last remnants of his patience, for he knew that this was their only chance. And after many minutes, during which the only sounds were those of wind and rain, Legolas spoke. \"This is your decision then? For you are right: The choice is partly yours. Is it indeed your earnest desire to leave these lands?\"  Gimli returned the Elf's look steadily. \"It is my earnest desire to journey at your side.\"  Another long moment passed, and then it was as though life returned to Legolas's eyes. The corners of his mouth twitched, and a weariness that had burdened him for years seemed to fall from his face. \"It is enough,\" he said. \"We shall sail. Whether we sail to life or ruin, I know not, but whatever our fate, we shall meet it together.\"  A weight lifted itself from Gimli's chest. \"Together,\" he echoed, smiling. And nestled within the breeze, somewhere behind the patter of rain, Gimli fancied he heard the rustlings of a rowan tree."}

I knew Thorin, of course; and I wish I had been there, but I was away at the time of your first visit to us. And I was not allowed to go on the quest; too young, they said, though at sixty-two I thought myself fit for anything. Well, I am glad to have heard the full tale. If it is full. I do not really suppose that even now you are telling us all you know.\"   Gandalf:  \"Of course not.\"  \u2014 Unfinished Tales : \"The Quest of Erebor\"  -0-0-0-0-0-   Chapter 1: Of Kin   The moment his pony set foot in the entry cavern, Gimli knew that something was different. There was an expectant feeling in the air. This feeling did not lend itself to excitement or celebration, but neither did it evoke fear or unease. Rather, it was as though the dwarves of the Blue Mountains waited for something, and they did not yet know if this something boded good or ill.  Frowning, Gimli swung down from his pony and led the beast to one side as the trade wains filed in behind him. From the passage leading to the First Hall, a steady stream of dwarves pushed their way into the spacious entry cavern to greet the returning wains. Many were merchants, eager to see the wares for which they had traded. Others were tasked with caring for the ponies or unloading the wains. Casting his eyes over all who had come forth to greet them, Gimli searched for someone who might be able to tell him what was causing this expectant hum, and at length, his gaze rested on Kili. Gimli looked no further. Neither Fili nor Kili had ever been able to mask their emotions, and Kili's current expression indicated that he was bursting with news.  As one of the trading party's guards, Gimli's duties dictated that he remain with the wains until all the goods had been delivered, the animals seen to, and the trading party itself disbanded. But at sixty-two, Gimli's responsibilities were minor, and the strange mood buzzing through those assembled was so unsettling that Gimli decided he could spare a few minutes to talk to Kili. Handing his pony off to a convenient stable hand, Gimli made straight for Kili, who turned toward him as though drawn by Gimli's intent stare.  \"Gimli!\" Kili cried out. \"You arrived sooner than we had expected. By my reckoning, you should still be a week away at the least!\"  \"The snow melted quickly this year and the roads were open,\" Gimli answered. \"N\u00edr felt that we should make an early start for home.\"  \"I am glad you did, for it is good to see you again! I know that your father will also be pleased to see you.\"  \"And I him,\" Gimli said, his eyes narrow. Kili was fairly dancing with excitement, which puzzled Gimli greatly. It did not match the uncertainty of the dwarves that milled around them.  \"Gl\u00f3in would be here to greet you if he could, but Thorin is holding a council with the elders and gave orders that he was not to be disturbed. Thorin is having a\u2026\" Kili paused and looked about before lowering his voice. \"Thorin is having a bit of a dragon day,\" he confessed. \"Though it would be more accurate to say a dragon month. I doubt the sentries will risk his wrath to inform the council of your return.\"  The puzzle grew. Thorin was well known for both his pride and his temper, a combination that held dire consequences for any who ran afoul of him on what Fili and Kili had dubbed his  dragon days . Dragon days were the days in which the demands of his lineage and the pressure of his father's vows to retake the Lonely Mountain weighed heavily upon Thorin. Among dwarves, a father's vow left unfulfilled became a son's vow, and Thorin was nothing if not an obedient son. When reminded of the vengeance oath that both Thr\u00e1in and Thor had sworn against Smaug, Thorin would become fey and brash. He would speak at length of the dishonor to Durin's line and the need to confront the dragon in battle, and any who countered with arguments for prudence did so at their own peril. When Thorin had dragon days, it was best to be somewhere other than the Blue Mountains. And if Thorin had been having a month of dragon days, Gimli was at a loss as to why Kili seemed so happy.  \"Is Thorin well?\" Gimli asked. \"My father and I exchanged letters while I was away, but naught was said of Thorin.\"  \"Possibly he did not feel it was his place to say anything,\" Kili said with a shrug.  \"Then Thorin's mood has been evident to everyone? It was not just you as a close kinsman who noticed his\u2014\" and as Kili had earlier, Gimli now also paused and looked around, \"\u2014his dragon days?\" he finished with a whisper. The term  dragon days  did not always go over well with the older dwarves who remembered Smaug's descent upon the Lonely Mountain.  \"All within the mountains have felt it,\" Kili murmured, also keeping his voice low.  \"What is the cause, do you think?\"  Kili shrugged again. \"Unrest? Memories?\"  Gimli chewed on his beard as he debated his next words. He could continue the conversation and look for subtle ways to ask about whatever was making Kili so happy, or could he strike right at the heart of the matter and appease his growing impatience. Gimli looked at Kili, who continued to radiate suppressed excitement, and decided that a subtle approach would be wasted here. Kili was not in the habit of keeping tidings to himself, and Gimli was mildly surprised that he had not already shared his good news. \"Well, whatever is troubling Thorin, it does not seem to trouble you,\" Gimli observed. \"You look as though you have just found your first vein of ore. Mayhap whatever makes you so cheerful will cheer Thorin also.\"  \"Ah. Yes, well\u2026\" Kili stopped, apparently considering what to say next. Gimli wondered if it was a first for him. \"I doubt that the source for my own excitement would have much effect. Thorin does not put as much trust in Thark\u00fbn as I do, but\u2014\"  \"Thark\u00fbn? You mean Gandalf? The wizard?\" interrupted Gimli, who had heard more about the gray pilgrim from men and hobbits than he ever had from his fellow dwarves. \"What has he to do with Thorin?\"  Kili hesitated. \"I think Gl\u00f3in wanted to be the first to speak with you about this, but\u2026\" He trailed off, his lips pressed into a firm line, and then the strain of keeping a secret simply became too much. \"Well, it is likely you will hear of it from another ere you see your father. My dear Gimli,\" he said, his eyes sparkling, \"we have made plans to reclaim the Lonely Mountain.\"  Gimli blinked. \"The noise in here must be too loud, for it sounded as though you said something about reclaiming the Lonely Mountain.\"  Kili scowled. \"And what is wrong with that?\"  Several obvious answers sprang to mind, but this was not the place to voice them. And voicing these answers would require more than just a few minutes away from the wains. Turning around, Gimli caught the eye of N\u00edr, the wain-master, and nodded toward Kili. N\u00edr rolled his eyes with the look of a weary elder confronted by the whims of an impatient stripling. Gimli felt his hackles rise in response, but when N\u00edr nodded his consent, Gimli opted to keep his objections to himself. Having obtained permission to leave, he took Kili firmly by the arm and hauled him out of the crowded entry cavern and into the First Hall. Once there, he continued to pull his protesting kinsman along until he found a shadowed corner shielded from prying eyes, at which point he allowed Kili to wrest his arm free. \"You want to know what is wrong with attempting to reclaim the Lonely Mountain?\" Gimli demanded, struggling to keep his voice even.  \"Yes!\"  \"Kili, no dwarf in the Blue Mountains has courage enough to defy Thorin on his dragon days. Do you think they would fare better against an  actual  dragon? And bear in mind that our people are fewer now than they were when the dragon first descended! Thorin himself has lamented this, knowing we are not sufficiently numbered to confront Smaug. Nor have we sufficient arms! Even were we to convince everyone to embark on a journey of more than three hundred leagues, the task of forging enough weapons and shields capable of withstanding dragon fire is\u2014\"  \"Unnecessary,\" Kili answered, breaking into Gimli's tirade. \"Thorin is not leading an army to confront Smaug. He is leading only a small party. Thirteen, to be exact.\"  Gimli nearly choked on his beard.  \"And I,\" Kili finished with a proud flourish, \"have been selected as a member of that esteemed company.\"  Speechless, Gimli could only stare.  Kili stared back.  \"It is my fervent hope,\" Gimli said at length, \"that Gandalf's involvement was an attempt to prevent this.\"  \"Quite the opposite!\" Kili countered, his pride turning to sharp indignation. \"He encouraged Thorin to take a small group. And he is coming with us for at least a portion of the journey.\"  With all his others thoughts awhirl, Gimli welded himself to this nugget of information and struggled to make sense of it. Among men, Gandalf was known as a wizard of great power and no small renown, but among hobbits, he was known as the trouble-maker responsible for sending members of the Took family off on strange journeys. Having never met the wizard himself, Gimli had not been sure which of the competing views to believe, but considering all that he had heard in the last few minutes, he began to lean in the hobbits' direction.  \"Your father is also coming, and\u2014\"  \"My father?\" Gimli stammered, his mind skidding to a halt.  \"Yes. We're to leave next week and\u2014 Gimli? Gimli!\"  But Gimli heard no more. Quick strides carried him out of the First Hall and into the deeper passages where he swiftly made his way toward the residences and his family's chambers. He would have sought his father directly, but even Gimli knew better than to interrupt Thorin on a dragon day. So instead, he sought his mother. She would know the truth of this madness.  But when he swung open the door to his family's spacious caverns, he was met with silence.  A quick glance around the first room told Gimli that his mother was not here. Nor had she been here for some time. The chamber was ordered, clean, and free from the half-formed creations that were the products of his mother's eccentric smithing. She often brought an experiment home with the intention of working on it only to set it aside and forget about it the moment another idea caught her fancy. Her apprentices sometimes complained that the bulk of their time was spent clearing her forge of unfinished projects rather than learning her trade. But as Gimli took in his family's chambers, he saw none of the inexplicable designs that were his mother's trademark. Perhaps he would have to interrupt Thorin after all.  \"Gimli!\"  Or perhaps not. Startled, Gimli whipped about to find Gl\u00f3in standing in the doorway, his father's beard bristling as his lips curved up in a smile. \"Father,\" Gimli said simply, suddenly uncertain of how to begin this confrontation. He decided to let Gl\u00f3in make the first move.  The first move turned out to be a tight hug that endured longer than most of his father's greetings and ended with Gl\u00f3in stepping back and clapping his hands on Gimli's shoulders. \"Strike the anvil, but it is good to see you! When Thorin dismissed us, we heard that the wains had returned, and I am overjoyed to find you here already. Your mother is away north in the iron foundries, and she will be sorry she missed your arrival. We shall have to send word that\u2026\" Gl\u00f3in slowly trailed off, and his smile faded as he studied Gimli. \"Is something wrong? Did you encounter misfortune on the journey?\"  \"None to speak of, and the trading went well enough,\" Gimli answered, searching his father's face. \"Rather, it was what I found upon my return that concerns me.\"  Gl\u00f3in's expression sobered quickly, and he stepped back, his arms falling to his sides. \"You have spoken with Fili.\"  \"Kili,\" Gimli corrected.  Gl\u00f3in grunted. \"Nearly the same.\"  \"It is true then?\" Gimli pressed, unable to keep the anger from his voice.  His father sighed. \"I wanted to tell you myself.\"  \"Indeed? Had my trading party started home when we originally planned to do so and had we met with any setbacks upon the road, we would have arrived too late. Kili informs me that you are leaving next week.\"  \"You were scheduled to return before I was scheduled to leave. I had hoped that fate would be kind, and now my hopes are fulfilled: you are here!\"  \"But what if I had been delayed?\" Gimli demanded.  \"I had little say over the time set for our departure,\" Gl\u00f3in answered, his voice growing stern. \"Moreover, you are fully capable of tending your own forge, as you so frequently remind me. I did not think you would take offense at the thought that I trusted you to see to matters in my absence.\"  Gimli's eyes flashed, and he felt his temper rearing. \"I am not  offended . Rather, I am greatly alarmed by the apparent madness of my father who has elected to join twelve others in pitting their combined folly against the wiles and wits of a dragon!\"  This was the cue for Gl\u00f3in to become angry. To lash back. To refute Gimli's accusation with tales of heroism and valiant deeds, thus providing Gimli the opportunity to note that heroism and valiant deeds frequently led to exile and death. His father's temper could run as hot and deep as a smelter's furnace, and Gimli had spent decades learning how to turn that temper to his advantage. When Gl\u00f3in was emotional, Gl\u00f3in made mistakes, and those mistakes were what Gimli would use to show him the error of his ways.  But much to Gimli's surprise, there was no outburst. No flare of rage. No protest born of wounded pride. Rather, Gl\u00f3in seemed to shrink, dropping his head while his shoulders became stooped as though from fatigue. For the first time in Gimli's life, his father appeared old, and Gimli shuddered at the sight. \"Your mother said something very similar when I told her of our plans,\" Gl\u00f3in murmured. \"She is upset with me, and that is why she is away now.\" He sighed, and if possible, he seemed to grow even older. \"She does not understand why I must go. She is too consumed in her metal-working to feel the demands of our heritage.\" Gl\u00f3in lifted his eyes to meet Gimli's, and in them was a weary sadness that Gimli had never seen before. \"And you are too young.\"  Having said this, Gl\u00f3in turned away and moved toward a dark doorway that opened off the main entry hall. Gimli watched in confusion, uncertain if he should follow or not. This doorway was the entrance to the Fire Chamber, the place where tales were told and where secrets of the forge were handed down from generation to generation. It was not a room to be used casually, and when the fire was not lit, none but the head of the family could enter. But as Gimli stood there debating the matter, a golden light suddenly flared from within the Fire Chamber, and Gl\u00f3in appeared in the doorway, watching Gimli expectantly. Taking a deep breath, Gimli moved forward into the chamber, standing in silence while his father drew up a stool next to the large hearth. Once his father was seated, Gimli took a second stool and joined him beside the fire.  \"When you are older, you will understand better,\" Gl\u00f3in said softly, reaching into his tunic and pulling forth his pipe. \"At the present, you hear only the call of new lands and new journeys. Of glory and honor and the strength of iron bending beneath your hammer. But over time, these things will fade and the fires of our House will eat at your heart. They will burden your dreams until every night you walk halls you have never seen and touch stone you have never shaped. It is my curse as one descended directly from Durin, and barring some greater love, it will eventually be your curse, too.\" Gl\u00f3in sighed, and lighting his pipe, he blew a puff of smoke in the direction of the hearth. \"I can only imagine how this curse weighs upon Thorin. It was what drove Thr\u00f3r to ruin, and Thr\u00e1in after him. Now it grips Thorin, and he can wait no longer. In truth, I am surprised he waited as long as he has. \u00d3in and I feared he would march to the Lonely Mountain alone, much as Thr\u00f3r marched alone into Khazad-d\u00fbm.\"  \"But why must he march anywhere?\" Gimli asked, his voice as quiet as his father's. \"Our halls here can be made strong. There is trade, the veins run deep, and we have room to build and expand. Does this not satisfy the demands of our heritage?\"  \"As I said before, this is not something easily explained to one who has not felt the fires of our House, and here your youth shows,\" Gl\u00f3in said. \"But perhaps you will understand this: Thr\u00f3r bequeathed the responsibility of slaying the dragon to his descendants. You know what such an obligation entails, and of late, Thorin has felt the weight of that responsibility growing upon him.\"  Gimli frowned. He appreciated the seriousness of an oath taken either by a father or on behalf of a father. Entire clans of dwarves had initiated wars to satisfy such vows. But even that did not justify this foolish quest to free the Lonely Mountain. \"It is my understanding, father, that such vows are to be fulfilled only when the dwarves have strength enough to do so,\" he said. \"If Thorin were to concentrate his efforts here, would that not satisfy his obligation? For we could grow strong over time and build an army capable of ousting Smaug!\"  \"The Blue Mountains are not our home, Gimli,\" Gl\u00f3in said shortly. \"Not for the House of Durin. They are merely a refuge.\"  \"By that reasoning, the Lonely Mountain is not our home, either!\" Gimli pointed out, growing frustrated. \"It is a refuge from Khazad-d\u00fbm. Yet over time, it became home to our people, and Khazad-d\u00fbm became memory. Why can we not do likewise again?\"  Gl\u00f3in's eyes turned to the flickering flames in the hearth. \"The world was younger when we founded the Lonely Mountain, and we were not so few. But now we fade. Thorin does not believe we can build and sustain yet another stronghold. So many of our kin are scattered throughout the Grey Mountains, and D\u00e1in's following is far away in the Iron Hills. As for our people here, most dwarves in the Blue Mountains do not even know to which lineage they belong. We have in our midst descendants of the Firebeards and the Broadbeams, proud Houses both stout-hearted and brave. Their fathers stood with men and elves against the terror that was Morgoth! But the scions of those Houses have forgotten their heritage. They have forgotten almost everything of their past.\" Gl\u00f3in rubbed his brow, sinking low on his stool. \"Thorin fears that this is now happening to Durin's line. And in this, I share his fears.\"  \"But you have always told me that Durin's line cannot fade! That our House is the eldest and will also be the last! That we are protected in this!\"  \"We were so certain of that once,\" Gl\u00f3in murmured. \"Now it is difficult to be certain of anything.\"  \"Then why risk a venture to reclaim the Lonely Mountain?\" Gimli demanded. \"Why not build our strength and conserve our efforts? Why not wait until we  are  certain?\"  \"Because that time may never come!\" Gl\u00f3in answered, his eyes flashing. \"Have you heard nothing, Gimli? We are scattered! Exiled! Broken! The House of Durin is fading into obscurity. Soon it will mean nothing. As scions of that House, we have a responsibility to see that the eldest of the dwarf clans does not suffer the fate of the others!\" He shook his head, and the fire faded from his eyes. \"You will understand better when you are older. The burning of our lineage will come upon you then. Until such time, you hear only your youth.\"  Gimli's jaw tightened as he struggled to contain his growing displeasure. He did not take kindly to criticisms based on age. Young he might be, but he had traveled more extensively in the past twenty years than almost any other dwarf in the Blue Mountains. He had experience to temper his youth, and contrary to his father's beliefs, he  did  know something of the call of heritage. He had felt stirrings for both the Lonely Mountain and Khazad-d\u00fbm, though these stirrings were faint and fleeting at best. Still, Gimli felt they provided him with enough insight to understand some of what possessed Thorin. But convincing his father of that was another matter, so Gimli tried a different approach. \"Then why so small a party?\" he asked. \"Why not rally all those who still claim to be a part of Durin's line? At the least, you could send messages to D\u00e1in Ironfoot and ask him to join you!\"  \"That was Thorin's plan in the beginning,\" Gl\u00f3in said, taking a long pull from his pipe. \"But on a chance visit to Bree, he encountered Thark\u00fbn and asked the wizard's counsel. I know not what compelled him to do so, but the wizard has been a part of his plans ever since. And the wizard advised a small party.\"  \"Then the wizard knows little of dragons,\" Gimli declared.  \"You speak too boldly,\" Gl\u00f3in said, a measure of his sternness returning. \"And without wit. Thark\u00fbn is no simple conjurer. I would venture to say that he knows more of dragons than even the dwarves who still recall the fires that seared the Lonely Mountain! And yet\u2026\" Gl\u00f3in trailed off, his eyes clouding and his brow furrowing. \"I sometimes have the impression that we are pawns to him. Or if not pawns, pieces in a greater game. And while none of us are pieces that he would surrender willingly, there is still the greater game to be considered. I do not know what he would choose to do if our sacrifice furthered his ends.\"  \"Surely Thorin recognizes this!\"  \"He does,\" Gl\u00f3in said, \"but he has still yielded to the wizard's counsel. Thark\u00fbn advises a small force, so a small force it will be. But if it eases your mind, the wizard has provided\u2026tokens that may work to our advantage. It is possible that a small force will prove better than a great army.\"  \"And what manner of tokens are they?\"  Gl\u00f3in frowned. \"It is not my place to reveal. I will say only that they are heirlooms from the Kingdom Under the Mountain and that Thorin is their rightful keeper.\"  Which Gimli interpreted to mean that these tokens were not weapons or great machinations that might thwart a dragon. What they were, he could not guess, but one thing was becoming clear: Gl\u00f3in did not expect to return. It was a suspicion that had been niggling at Gimli the moment his father had failed to anger, and that suspicion was now confirmed by his father's words about Gandalf. Fear washed over Gimli, but as it did so, it was accompanied by another feeling. A desire of sorts, one that burned deep within his heart. It was not the fire of heritage that Gl\u00f3in described, but in some ways, it was stronger. More immediate. It was the burning fire of kin. Of the dwarven bond between father and son. It was a bond that had seared Gimli's heart before, and he knew he could not ignore it now. He still felt the quest to be a fool's errand, but it was an errand that Gimli could not allow his father to undertake alone.  \"So be it,\" he said, frightened by the weight of his decision but firm and unwavering regardless. \"If you will not turn aside and if Thorin is intent upon a small party, then I will say nothing more against it. Rather, I will join you.\"  Gl\u00f3in inhaled sharply. Unfortunately, he did so while in the midst of drawing on his pipe, and a coughing fit immediately ensued. The pipe clattered to the ground, and an alarmed Gimli thumped his father hard between the shoulders as Gl\u00f3in curled over his knees, his eyes weeping and his breath coming in rasping gasps. \"Absolutely not,\" he wheezed. \"Under no circumstances will I permit you to join us.\"  \"It is not your place to refuse,\" Gimli countered evenly, giving his father's back another hit. \"You do not lead this party. Only Thorin can deny me, and should he accept me as a companion, you have no right to gainsay him.\"  \"Gimli\u2014\"  \"And it is my right to claim a place in this endeavor!\" Gimli interrupted, raising his voice above his father's. \"You go to restore the glory of Durin's House, and as a member of that House, I choose to join you!\"  \"And as your elder in that House\u2014as well as your father\u2014I forbid it!\" Gl\u00f3in said, his tone sharp and cutting even as his efforts to speak prompted yet another bout of coughing.  Gimli waited for the coughs to subside before softly asking, \"If you do not forbid yourself, then why forbid me?\"  Gl\u00f3in's eyes blazed, but he said nothing.  \"Because my earlier words hold true,\" Gimli continued. \"The prudent course of action would be to bide our time and gather our strength, marching on the Lonely Mountain only when we are ready. But for reasons that my  youth  cannot fathom, Thorin chooses to go now. And since you have pledged to go with him, thus am I also bound!\"  \"If you would hold yourself bound to me, then bind yourself to my words!\" Gl\u00f3in roared, still coughing. \"I will not allow this!\"  \"Your words hold no bearing in this case. Such a matter is for Thorin to decide,\" Gimli said curtly as he rose to his feet. He gave his father's back one more perfunctory slap and then moved away, leaving the Fire Room and making for the outer door.  \"Thorin will not decide in your favor!\" Gl\u00f3in called after him amidst his coughs, his voice trembling with anger.  \"We shall see,\" Gimli answered, and he left before his father could follow."}

He hummed softly to himself as he walked, glad that he had been able to get away for this trip. It had been two months since Gimli and he had parted since their return from the War. It felt good to have returned home, but his family saw how much he missed the friend he had made in his travels, and so they had shooed him on his way with instructions to tell Gimli to visit again soon. Oh, how he looked forward to seeing the dwarf again! A message had been sent to Gimli through the men of Dale, who were on friendly terms with the dwarves. A reply stated his friend would be expecting him and looked forward to his visit.  Being expected, Legolas made his way up the slope with little concern, following the map Gimli had sent. The sudden screaming of his senses, proclaiming danger, took him a bit off guard, and he froze in his tracks. A thud sounded, and he found, in the ground before him, where he would have been if he had not stopped, a dwarven throwing ax lay deeply imbedded in the ground.  Glancing up from the axe, he discovered a group of four dwarves approaching him, and angry dwarves judging by their countenances. Each dwarf was heavily bearded and wearing chain mail over a colored tunic. And all were armed with axes as well. Legolas felt grave concern over the expressions on their faces. He had learned from watching Gimli that if a dwarf looked like that, there was going to be trouble \u2014 big trouble usually. Uncertain, he stooped and picked up the axe, noting it's fine, sharp edge. Straightening, he faced the advancing dwarves and smiled, trying to sound cheerful. Anything to ease the tension in the air around them.  \"Greetings, my good dwarves! I am Lego\u2014\"  A booming voice interrupted him. \"We know who you are, elf!. And you would be wise to stay where you are and toss away the axe!\" The dwarf that spoke was black-haired and wearing a red tunic. Standing to either side of the speaker stood his mirror copies, only with brown hair and beards, one in blue and the other in yellow. And slightly behind them stood a dwarf that looked very much like Legolas suspected Gimli must have appeared when he was younger, sporting wild auburn hair and wearing a black tunic. Gimli's brothers, perhaps? He swallowed. All were giving him menacing glares.  Legolas complied with their wishes, tossing the axe forward a few paces. He had no desire to cause any trouble, but he was very confused about their grim demeanors. He was expected, was he not? The black-haired one said they knew who he was! So what was the meaning of this reception? Surely Gimli had told the others he was coming? He swallowed again, watching the advancing dwarves with a wary gaze.  The dwarves halted a few yards away. One of them, the dwarf in blue, picked up the axe and slipped it back into his belt.  \"We know who you are,\" the dwarf in red repeated. \"And you are not welcome here. We don't know how you enchanted our brother, but you won't be enchanting anyone else! We will find a way to release him from your foul spell!\"  Legolas blinked. So they were Gimli's brothers. Oh bother it all, he had not counted on the ongoing animosity between the elves and the dwarves being a hindrance to his visit. This would not be fun at all, if Gimli's family did not accept him!  Holding his hands out, palms up in a sign of peace, he smiled, trying to reason with his greeters. \"I assure you, I have done nothing to Gimli, other than befriend him. I do not understand why you would think such things, but perhaps if you would call him, he could explain...\"  \"And let you ensnare him even more?\" The dwarf in blue asked, his brows rising up his forehead.  \"He's lying,\" the one in yellow cried, fingering his axe.  \"Probably wants to enchant us, too,\" the red-headed dwarf murmured, though of the four, he looked the least convinced.  \"And how do you explain that foul creature?\" the one in yellow spit out the question. \"Huh? Do you have any idea what followed our brother home? Almost killed Grayn, it did!\"  Foul creature? What did he have to do with that? He could not think of what they meant\u2014 A sudden suspicion sent trickles of apprehension down his spine.  Oh, no. Tell me she did not...  But it would explain her absence these past weeks, would it not?  Legolas sighed. \"I beseech you, please listen to me. I know not of what you speak. Please only fetch Gimli, and I am sure we can put whatever has happened behind us.\" He started to question why he had ever agreed to visiting his friend's home. Gimli could not have thought it a good idea considering his family's misconceptions about him!  \"Do you think we are so stupid?\" Yellow shirt growled. \"You sent a warg after our brother! It found Grayn first.\" He pointed at the dwarf just behind them, the one that looked so much like Gimli, who was bobbing his head, eyes wide. \"Luckily we were able to fend it off. Only, whatever you did to our brother has his brain so addled he took the creature into the mountain with him! The darn thing sleeps on his bed at night! And you try to say you did not put him under a spell?\"  The group of dwarves threw each other suspicious looks and red shirt nodded. \"Get him!\" As a group they rushed Legolas, who still stood in shock over all he had heard.  Legolas had wondered where Draugalu had wandered off to, but she was prone to such things. And if he was not being rushed by four angry dwarves, he would have laughed that she had followed Gimli home. The female warg, who he had raised from a pup, had taken a shine to his friend when he had visited the Greenwood.  He leapt back to avoid the onrush of angry brothers, but found it had been an unnecessary move. Before they could reach him, a voice called out, and all four suddenly stopped in their tracks.  \"What is wrong with you idiots? Do you wish to dishonor your family by attacking Gimli's friend?\" The speaker stepped into view, and Legolas gazed upon another dwarf. This one also had auburn hair, but lighter in shade than that of Gimli's and black shirt's hair. And this one wore no mail, just a plain brown tunic belted over dark trousers.  Due to his family, Legolas had much experience with females. He had a wonderful wife, a beautiful daughter, a mischievous granddaughter and numerous nieces, not to mention his mother and brother's wife. Legolas had prided himself on charming the ladies of his family. And so, even though brown shirt was appeared much like the others in build and beard, and spoke gruffly like a dwarf should, Legolas picked up on little things that assured him this one was different. This dwarf was female. He smiled.  \"I don't know what you think you are doing! Mother is going to kill you! She told you to leave the elf alone.\" The dwarf-woman crossed her arms across her chest, tapped her booted foot much like any woman of Legolas's acquaintance, and glared at the four brothers who had turned toward her. They were looking guilty...and to Legolas's amusement, afraid.  Legolas just stared. He had been shocked by many things in his life, but never had he anticipated this visit to be so eventful. And he had not even seen Gimli yet! The dwaf-woman met his eyes and smiled, and when she did, her eyes twinkled and he thought she was lovely, for a dwarf.  She uncrossed her arms and approached, holding out her hand. \"Galin,\" she said, \"sister of Gimli, daughter of Gl\u00f3in at your service.\"  Legolas took her hand but did not know whether to shake it or kiss it. He did not remember if Gimli had ever said how one greeted a dwarf-woman. However, Gl\u00f3in was a dwarf of high position, and so Legolas opted for the latter, bending low to bring her fingers to his lips. Galin giggled lightly \u2014 he had not known dwarves  could  giggle \u2014 and pulled her hand back as a red blush crawled over her face.  \"Now, now Master Elf! Gimli told me you were married. You should not be flirting so with unwed females.\" Galin chastised him with a coy smile.  Legolas flushed in embarrassment. He had not meant to give her  that  impression! \"Forgive me, my lady. It is the custom of my people to greet a lady in such a manner.\" He bowed. \"Legolas Thranduilion, at your service.\"  She inclined her head, her eyes twinkling with amusement. \"Nice to finally meet you, Legolas.\"  He smiled, realizing she had only been teasing him. \"Is Gimli expecting me? I do hope Draugalu has not caused any problems. I apologize for any trouble she may have been. I never thought she'd follow Gimli home!\"  \"Draugalu is a dear and has been no trouble except when she sat on Grayn and washed his face repeatedly! Seems she mistook him for Gimli.\" She gave him a wicked grin. \"I would have paid handsomely to have witnessed it!\" Inclining her head towards the mountain, she continued,\"Gimli is expecting you and is being notified that you are here, as we speak. Forgive the rudeness of my brothers. They do not understand how it is possible for Gimli to have befriended an elf.\"  Legolas walked with her towards the entrance to the mountain, but could not help noticing Gimli's brothers had slipped away. For some reason, he did not think he had seen the last of them. What a shocking way to start his visit!"}

He fought to keep his breath while he pushed one leg before\nthe other in his race. They were near the hospital camp and the\nprecious object in his arms was not something he dared to slow for.\nBehind him many others bore equal weights, some feeling the same\nsense of trepidation for theirs as he did his.  He came into the camp\nmade up of a cluster of buildings. Word had come before them and many\nwere running out to meet Thranduil and his company. \"Calonin to\nme!\" he called to the healer he well knew, not allowing any to\nhesitate about who would serve him. He wanted a healer with\nexperience and he would choose. He knew all could understand what was\nin his heart, for it did not take a wise man to decipher the bulk of\nhis burden.  \"Here!\" the healer\npointed, indicating the stretcher that could serve in need as a\nsurgical table. \"What has come to him?\"  \"We were attacked,\"\nthe king weakly supplied. He watched as the healer bent over the\nbody, laying his head upon the chest. \"Can you help him?\"\nThranduil asked, but the healer was too caught up in his work to pay\nhim heed.  The patient's cloak\nwas drawn aside. Copious amounts of blood poured from the wound and\nhe immediately pressed the cloth back into place. The ravaging\neffects of the battle had been laid bare to him in that glance. \"It\nis a Dooming Wound,\" Calonin murmured. His eyes came up swiftly,\nmaking contact with Thranduil's before he turned his head to each\nside. Healers and their aides were at work all around making it\ndifficult to discern what other possible injuries there were.  Thranduil supplied what\nthe healer sought. \"One is dead,\" he recounted grimly, \"Four\nothers suffered the sting of the forest spiders in the same attack.\nTwelve more were wounded by Orc blade, but no other is like him.\"\nHe nodded to the elf before them.  The healer fixed him\nwith steely eyes. There was a reason Thranduil had cried out for this\nparticular elf and he waited for confirmation of what he likely\nsuspected.  Thranduil knew he must\nspeak words he wished never to say. \"He took the wound from a\nmorgul blade,\" the king supplied, his voice cracking in choked\nfear. \"He suffered the full of the Nazgul's wrath.\"  The healer paused, the\nimpact of this news working over his features. And then he swallowed\nit, accepting what he must do. \"Not the full. If he had, he would\nbe dead now,\" Calonin said as he returned to his examination with\ngrim determination. \"He suffers the vile clutches of the Black\nBreath,\" the ancient elf pointed out, shaking his head as he\nwatched his patient's eyes open briefly. They were red-rimmed and\nfilled with fear, and it was clear that this elf was unaware of where\nhe was or what was happening to him. His breath came in quick gasps.\nHis eyes drifted closed as he lapsed into nightmare dreams. The\nhealer lifted the cloak, glancing again at the injury and using a\nclean rag to wipe away new blood. The cut was clean but he was not\npleased. \"It struck near his heart.\"  \"I know this.\"\nThranduil said, tiring of the redundancy in the exam. He sought\naction as he turned desperation upon the physician. \"What I would\nknow is if he will survive it?\" He knew what fate had delivered\nthem; what he wanted was its truth revealed.  \"Your son has a\nstrong will,\" the healer said indicating the patient before him.\nBut he said no more, and Thranduil was left without an answer. In his\nlife he had seen the Nazgul's handiwork many times. Sometimes an\ninjury would be minor while other times the wound had a fatal effect.\nAnd usually the Black Breath played a part, causing the victim to\nfall into agonizing despair, trapped in dreams of horror while the\nbody fought off this affliction without aid.  But there was worse\nthat could happen. Thranduil shuddered at the thought of it but he\nknew it well. If the wound was tainted and a remnant of the Nazgul's\nblade was left within, the victim could become as one with his\nassailant; he too would become a Wraith.  One time before he had\nwitnessed such a fate. It nearly broke him to act on it then. He did\nnot think it was within him to do so again.  The healer set to work,\ncalling others to his aid. They lifted the stretcher quickly carrying\nit into the nearest building and putting it into the cross braces\nthat brought it to table height. Thranduil helplessly watched while\nLegolas was made ready for the rigors of surgery. His hands reached\nout to caress the fingers of the younger elf, tenderly offering to\nsooth though he knew Legolas' mind was beyond all knowing. He felt\nthe subtle tremor of a body in stress, and he willed his heart into\nhis son's, praying for relief from any suffering.  Legolas' face\ncontorted with pain, though the king could not be certain its cause.\nIt was either the wound or the hellish dreams induced by the Nazgul's\nbane. Both were enough to bring hopeless agony. Thranduil felt a\nsmall sob escape him as the grips of his own terror mixed with the\nconvoluted chokehold of worry and guilt.  \"Do not mourn him\nyet. Not all situations are as dire as those of your recollections,\"\na soft voice whispered into his ear, and though Thranduil did not\nturn his head, he knew who spoke.  \"I must see to my\nmen,\" he said, ignoring the voice, choosing instead to disengage\nfrom the hospital scene. He gently laid his son's hand upon the\ntable and turned to the healer he was entrusting with his son. \"See\nto it he survives,\" he commanded Calonin. Their eyes met. \"You\nknow what it is I speak of. Do not let this be his fate.\"  \"I will do my best,\nmy lord,\" the healer said, bowing his head. Indeed he did know, but\nthe outcome was not his to decide, and Thranduil knew he was putting\nan undue burden on the elf.  \"You are not so cruel\nas that,\" the cool voice admonished from behind, but Thranduil\nwalked from the building.  He must keep himself\noccupied and concern for his men always distracted him from his own\nworries. \"Athedon,\" the king called out to the first elf he saw,\n\"Report to me.\"  The broad-shouldered\nelf he jumped to Thranduil's side. Orc blood still smeared one\ncheek, and a cut was visible across his brow. His clothes bore the\nbrownish stain of spider venom, but Thranduil knew that was likely a\nremnant of the man he had aided. \"Epheron is the only casualty thus\nfar, my lord. All the others are being seen to.\"  \"And you?\" the king\nasked, catching the lost look in the elf's eyes. Thranduil saw\nshock there. The attack had come as a complete surprise and the elf\ncould not be immune to it. He was yet young and new to these fighting\nforces. But it was hard to know without asking if he had the sense to\ntake responsibility for his own healing.  \"I am next on the\nhealer's list, my lord,\" Athedon returned, and Thranduil was\npleased. The elf was not so na\u00efve as to think such an ordeal\ncould go without effect.  \"Good,\" Thranduil\nsaid, patting him on the shoulder as he continued to make his rounds.  \"And what of you?\nWill you not see to your injuries?\" the voice asked, finding him\nonce again though it had been Thranduil's intent to escape such\nqueries.  Thranduil sighed as he\nmarched further on. It was inevitable that a confrontation must\noccur. As he walked, he could not help recognizing remnants of the\npast. Each tree, stone, statue and wall that he saw spoke to him from\na time before, when life had had grace.  They had established\nthis refuge at the old palace some time back when they had started\ntheir fight in the darkest regions of the wood. From time to time the\nhealers' camp had to be moved, but usually the battlelines were\ndrawn near this place and more than not the elves were able to\nprotect this safe house.  Yet for Thranduil, it\nwas not safe. Memory marred it.  \"This is my fault,\"\nhe finally said to his follower, laying the blame before them.  \"Do not be so\nungentle. Legolas is accountable, not you. It was his tenacious\nambitions that brought him to these circumstances. It had been his\nintent all along to vanquish this foe. Your situation only gave him\nthe impetus to act upon it.\"  \"Nay, it was my\ndoing,\" Thranduil objected. And at that moment he could see the\nscene that had led to their current predicament. He saw the battle\nand the felling wound. Confusion had ruled in the moments of battle\nand still Thranduil had seen it. He should have tried to stop it.   They had been caught\nat complete unawares. Night had only just fallen and it was not\ntypical for their enemy to strike so early. Usually it was far later\nin the evening before the forest's evil made its appearance. It was\nas if they had expected Thranduil and his forces to be in this place\nat exactly this moment.     The elves had been\nmoving, stealthily darting through the trees. They had thought they\nwere advancing on the enemy camp and had scouted the location\ncarefully. They had thought this, but they were wrong.     The spiders were\nfirst to come, dropping from the trees. Within seconds, orcs\nfollowed, leaping out from seemingly nowhere. They came from all\nsides. Two elves were stung before the others could compensate for\nthe rush. But they fought, recovering as best they could, taking far\nfewer wounds than might have been expected given the ferocity of the\ncharge.     Thranduil was locked\nin a tight battle, meeting the blows of a sizeable foe. Taking\nadvantage of a misstep, Thranduil plunged his sword into the belly of\nthe creature, finding nothing but soft matter to meet the biting edge\nof his blade. The creature fell, and the king looked around, using\nthe brief moment to assess where he might strike next.     To his left, a group\nof his men maintained the advantage, while on his right, several\nothers fought one-on-one with their orcish foe. Further on, could see\nthe few spiders that remained being annihilated, limbs being hacked\nthrough. Legolas was among them, and he too found time enough to meet\nThranduil's eye. He nodded and then he wheeled around and was\ninstantly engaged in a new fight, his sword clanging as he parried an\nenemy strike. But Thranduil did not follow his actions. He knew\nLegolas was skilled and he would not fall when they were so evenly\nmatched. The elves had the advantage.     Thranduil then saw\nan elf who was flagging, and he jumped to his aid. Fleetingly, as the\nfight went on, he was able to glance around enough to see that his\nmen were winning. This fight would soon end.    But that was when he\nsensed the greater part of evil. It was like a shroud falling over\nhis soul and his mind turned from jubilation for what was to be\nvictory to dread of the deepest kind. He could not even put it into\nhis mind what was happening, so deep was the disturbance, and an\nuncontrollable shudder moved through him.   \" Nazgul!\"\nsomebody gasped, and Thranduil was able then to affirm the sensation.\nThat was what he felt.    A shattering cry\ntore the night apart. He felt the air leave his lungs as Thranduil\ndropped to his knees. So paralyzing was the Nazgul's call. About\nhim he saw elves collapsing in terror. They shrank in the pending\ndarkness of the Wraith's presence, each crying out their lament for\nthis peril. But that gave reason for the orcs to fight even harder.\nThranduil was on his feet immediately, pulling his men upright,\ncrying to them to fight, to fight!    And then Legolas was\nthere, doing the same, urging them on. Pride filled Thranduil's\nheart, pushing away the doom that pierced his heart. His son had the\nstrength in him to fight, as he knew he would. They should all fight.\nThey wanted only to live!    Still, the elves\nwere weakened where the orcs found strength. And though the orcs'\nnumbers could no longer match that of the elves, they smiled with\nglee for the disheartening effect such a presence had.     Their might was\nshadowed by the phantom menace. The Nazgul drew forth toward the\nclearing and despite their efforts to overcome it, the pervading\ngloom penetrated any light encouragement could bring. The Wraith was\nthere and there was time no more for cowering or fear. A fresh horde\nof orcs followed in his path, and again the battle commenced.    Thranduil had no\ntime to think. He merely reacted, parrying, lunging, thrusting,\nslaying as best he could.    For a minute the\nNazgul merely watched, as if trying to decide where he would put his\nenergies. But after that minute the focus of his attack became clear.\nHe sought Thranduil.     The orcs that had\nbeen pressing the elf stepped aside, but the king found himself\nbacking away despite their withdrawal. The dark phantom edged near,\nmeeting Thranduil's defenses.     The clang their\nswords threw up sparks. Strike for strike the ringing sound of those\naggressive blows filled his ears. Thranduil pursued thrusts of his\nown but the effort was fruitless. The Wraith was there with every\nmove.     But like a lightning\nflash someone came into the periphery of his vision and Thranduil\nrealized someone had come to his aid. He barely could look aside to\nsee who, for the fight went on. He did become aware of his\nsurroundings though. It was as if he had been released from some\nspell. The clacking of the spiders' racket, the clang of swords,\nthe screams and cries of both elves and orcs alike -- all filled his\nears. And above the din, Thranduil realized it was Legolas that\nfought at his side.     Their eyes met as\nthey simultaneously dashed past the Nazgul threat. In that instant,\nThranduil read his son's intent. It had been there all along, only\nnow the opportunity had been availed to him. The king knew he should\nhave predicted such a thing for he had seen that fierce expression\ncountless times over the years. He had fostered it. So fast was the\nmotion. But the king knew, without an ounce of doubt, his son meant\nto kill the Nazgul.     The task was near\nimpossible. Thranduil knew as much, as did his son. But only a few\ndays before he had revealed their close history with this vile\ncreature. If there was ever a time when the idea had been affirmed,\nit was then. He should not have spoken of it!    He tried to cry out,\nto stop Legolas. But the actions around them both were too fast, a\nblur to his eyes, and all he could do was try to maintain his part,\ndefending himself from what was before him.     His breath was\ncoming fast; he was assailed once more, only now the orcs had\nrejoined the fight. And Legolas? Where was he?    He was thrown to the\nground; he'd been struck from behind, waylaid by some orc, but the\naction was not completed. The creature backed away, leaving Thranduil\nopen for the Nazgul's blade. The demon had his sword in hand.\nThranduil gazed up to where eyes would have been had the creature\nsuch things. He tried to read the monster, but he could not.     The blade was\npoised, fixed to his heart, and he knew what was coming. He closed\nhis eyes to the killing blow.    It never came.\nInstead a familiar cry rang out and startled, he looked up to see\nLegolas plunge his knife into the Nazgul's spine. The creature\ncried out. What a terrible noise. He turned to face his assailant.\nHis scream was the same piercing noise that had earlier sent his men\nto their knees. Yet this time, Thranduil did not shrink under the\nviolent cry. He watched as the dark creature drew a knife from the\nscabbard at his waist. This was done in the same motion as his turn\nyet the motion seemed to take on a lazy stillness. Legolas appeared\nparalyzed by the confrontation, shocked even, as if he could not\nbelieve that the creature was still standing. Legolas did not raise\na hand in his own defense as the Nazgul struck the blade into his\nchest,   \" No!!!\"\nThranduil screamed, finding himself suddenly on his feet, running to\nhis son.    The Nazgul was gone,\nfleeing into the darkness, but Thranduil did not bother to follow. He\nwas fixed on his son, crying out some nonsensical yelp as he watched\nLegolas' eyes lose focus and his head fall back. The young elf's\nknees folded beneath him but Thranduil was there to catch him before\nLegolas' body could meet the ground.   That memory was forced\nback into his mind as he sobbed with the anguish of it. He was\nshaking; tears spilled from his eyes. He sought out the solace that\nhis soul might offer, but he tossed it aside in the same breath.  \"I instilled it in\nhim,\" he insisted to the other who had been taunting him. He would\nnot let his guilt be tempered by reason. His son was blameless. Deep\nin his soul he sought a means for forgiveness. He desperately craved\nit even if he could not give it to himself.  The other was still\nthere. He was  always  there, though unlike their usual ways,\nthis time a long silence followed. The words of absolution Thranduil\nhad grown accustomed to hearing were not there. Instead whispered\nwords came to him, \"I cannot help you if you would take this only\nupon yourself.\"  The other moved away\neven though Thranduil had not yet met his gaze. Absently the king\nwondered how long it had been since he had tried to do such a thing.\nA long time , he conceded. There would be no peace until he was\nwilling to take that step.  He glanced over his\nshoulder, smiling sardonically. There was no mirth in the expression.\nHe was not ready though he had the will still to live. \"Very well\nthen,\" he said, \"This is truly  your  fault, Father.\"  The specter of Oropher\ngazed back at him, voided by means of a body and enshrouded in shadow\nwhere form was meant to be. The ghost did not smile. His expression\nremained grim. \"That is not progress,\" he said, turning again to\nwalk away. Thranduil was left without aid. He had nothing to do but\nthink about what might come while self-recrimination, his other\ncompanion, remained.  oOoOoOoOoOo  Thranduil stared at the\nfire as he waited for word from the healers. His elven warriors\ngathered along with him as the night deepened. He realized their\npresence and knew they were there to console him if he should ask it\nof them. They cared for Legolas too and he appreciated their concern.  As the night had gone\non, those stung by the spiders had begun to come about. The elves who\nhad suffered injury at the hands of the orcs were also bandaged and\nresting under the healers' care. And the slain elf was being\ndelivered, even now, into the hands of his kin. All that was unknown\nwas Legolas' condition.  The king's eyes\nlingered on the coals within the blaze. It seemed so odd, the peace\nthat pervaded given the earlier horror.  It feels much as it had\nonly days ago , he thought.  And it was, for they\nhad been sitting about the campfire then as well. Only Legolas had\nbeen with them as they had exchanged tales of ancient times and lore.\nDespite the dark place where they resided, their spirits were high.\nThey had been laughing.  Thranduil blinked and\nlooked about him now. Hidden beyond the overgrowth of what had once\nbeen a sparring court, Thranduil saw his father gazing at him. He\nstood in the arched doorway of the old armory building.  Go away,\nghost!  he thought, but he knew the elf was there as a reminder\nwhat had happened before.  \"My lord.\" Calonin\ncalled from the door of their improvised healing house.  Thranduil jumped to his\nfeet. He knew he was disappointing the warriors who waited for word,\nbut he could not know this here.  Calonin led him to\nLegolas' bed. A blanket was tucked around his son's waist. He was\nbare-chested and a white bandage was wrapped about his shoulder and\nchest though there was little difference in the color of that to his\nskin. Though unnaturally white, an exerted flush touched his cheeks\nand the light sheen of fever was visible on Legolas' brow.\nThranduil watched as it furrowed, then he noted the twitches and\ngasps of an unseen torment. It was telling. Legolas remained quite\nill.  He took his son's\nlimp hand into his own then looked to the healer. The concern marking\nhis face said what words could not.  \"We could find no\nshards of the blade within the wound, and we have repaired what harms\nwe found. We think it is the Black Breath that plagues him now.\"  Thranduil leaned in\nclose, finding a chair suddenly materializing beneath him. Calonin\nhad quietly brought it to him, knowing with a healer's perception\nthat the king would not be parted from his son's side.  \"The Black Breath,\"\nhe repeated. \"Do you know this with certainty?\" He ached to hear\nsome good.  \"No, my lord.\"  Thranduil squeezed the\nhand tighter as he swallowed the words. \"Does he show any signs\nof...?\" He could not complete the thought over the lump that was\nchoking him.  \"We have only\ndetected the physical agonies so far,\" Calonin replied in as\nconsoling a voice as could be mustered given the circumstances. \"What\nyou are seeing may be the vexation of his dreams alone. We can know\nno more until time has passed or he awakens. The signs will become\nclearer then if indeed his blood is turning dark. We must wait, my\nlord.\"  Legolas sighed in his\ndreams, as if catching a breath after a race. His head turned to the\nside with his moan. \"Not long,\" Thranduil said as he drew his\nhand to his son's brow. \"If I recall, once the change comes, it\nis swift.\"  \"We are ready should\nit need be done,\" Calonin replied. Thranduil did not need to know\nwhat  it  was. He was already familiar.  \"Is there nothing you\ncan offer for this?\" he asked, indicating his son's misery as\nLegolas moaned out a sob.  \"Athelas is being\nbrought,\" the healer answered and no sooner had he said it did\nattendants appear bearing the steeping pots. Thranduil nodded. The\nweed might help clear the toxic airs of the demon rabble.  \"I will give you your\npeace,\" Calonin said when all was properly administered. \"I will\nbe near should you need me.\" He bowed his way out leaving Thranduil\nalone with his son.  \"Legolas,\" he\nwhispered, leaning over the pale elf's form. Though he knew it a\nfruitless exercise, he willed himself into his son's dreams. For a\nmoment, Legolas' brow smoothed.  \"I am with you,\" he\ncontinued, encouraged. \"Nothing more will befall you, my son. Stay\nwith me.\"  But Legolas' dreams\ntook a bad turn and he cried out once more  \"Hush,\" he soothed,\nfinding himself drawn into the makeshift bed. He lifted his son's\nlimp form to him gently, cradling the head and shoulders as he\ncontinued to croon quieting noises and to stroke the fair head.  Legolas' gasps and\nsobs slowly stilled within the protective walls of his father's\narms, and after a time it seemed he dozed. Thranduil dared not move\nfeeling yet the hovering fever that heated his son's skin. It\nreminded him again of the warmth of the fire a few days before, and\nthe merriment they had felt had warded off the oppressive nature of\nthe dark forest surrounding them.  They had been talking\nabout the Last Alliance, and most specifically the battle that had\ndestroyed so many in that war.  \" You must\nunderstand; Oropher did not easily take orders, even in his days\nunder Thingol's rule,\" he had been explaining to the warriors\nabout him. \"Any who had served with him -- Celeborn being within\nthat number -- knew he was a good general. They also knew that there\nwas a way to handle the elf, and most certainly a way not to. You did\nnot just make demands and expect blind obedience from Oropher. His\nsong was of a different note than that.\"    The elves nodded in\nunderstanding, some having served with Oropher and having first hand\nknowledge, others not knowing him but imagining him through their own\nexperiences in life. Secretly Thranduil thought they might also be\nagreeing because they saw this trait in Legolas, and perhaps himself\nas well.     It was Legolas in\nfact who confirmed what Thranduil had been leading to. \"And that is\nwhy he did not follow the direct orders of the High King,\" the elf\nadded.     Thranduil nodded. He\nlowered his voice as he spoke. \"It is not that he did not follow\nthe orders, it was that he disregarded the timing of them. My father\nwas unaware that Gil-Galad had a tandem act going that would have\nserved a distraction for the Mirkwood forces. Had Oropher been told,\nthe timing could have been worked to better effect.\"    \" What was it the\nHigh King feared in not sharing his plan?\" someone else asked.   \" Gil-Galad did not\nfear sharing, he was simply pressed to get the details out to all the\nparties that be,\" Thranduil answered. \"Time was short and much\nwas decided on a whim. Yet when the plan had been constructed my\nfather had not been present. He was told his duty but not the\nreasoning why; the details were omitted. That is where Gil-Galad\nfailed. He should have realized my father was capable of tasking more\nthan what he was given and could have been a good aide had he been\nput to it.\"   \" I have heard Lord\nCeleborn say as much,\" one of the warriors commented.    Thranduil smiled.\n\"It pleases me much to know this has been said.\"   \" Tell of the\nbattle,\" Legolas prompted, his eyes bright with pride.   \" You know the tale\nas well as I. You tell it,\" Thranduil chided, smiling at his son's\neagerness, even if the subject was a painful one.   \" But you were\nthere,\" the younger said.    Thranduil's smile\nslipped. \"I was that,\" he said. \"We had no idea what it was we\nwould encounter.\"   \" The Nazgul,\"\nLegolas supplied, his expression watchful as a dark dread fell over\nthe group.   \" That was\nOropher's end, was it not?\" one warrior asked among them.    \" It was,\"\nThranduil conferred.   \" But his death led\nto knowledge which may yet bring the downfall of our foe,\" Legolas\nadded with clear optimism.   \" It did,\"\nThranduil agreed, cheering slightly, \"for it was Oropher who\nlearned the means of destroying the Witch King.\"   \" So has been said,\nmy lord,\" the elf nearest Thranduil remarked, \"but I have never\nlearned how he came to do this.\"   \" Please tell it,\nmy lord,\" Legolas urged once again. Thranduil smiled at his son.\nLegolas had heard this tale a hundred times at least since infancy\nand could probably recite it from his heart. He seemed to love the\nglory of his grandfather's sacrifice, and despite the loss of a\nking, he flourished under the knowledge that the elves of Mirkwood\nknew something of their fate through the fabric of that story. There\nwas pride in the light of the elf's eyes and Thranduil could not\nquell that. Besides, the king suspected there was magic in an elder's\nspoken words. What harm could come through inspiration such as this,\nespecially in knowing the elves before him might have to make like\nsacrifices?    He bowed his head as\nhe mentally put himself into the tale. \"The skies were dark over\nthose wicked grounds. The land was menaced with the foul grips of\ndestruction and gloom. The Dark Lord's reach was long, and darkness\nspread from the walled fortress of Mordor, leeching the lands to the\nnorth of anything just. It was there that we fought in those days,\nmarching relentlessly into battle day after day, year after year,\nspilling the blood of countless foe only to find for all ground\ntaken, it was lost again in the days after. That was the make of the\nwar. It continually raged. There was no respite.   \" But we had made\nheadway at last and had passed beyond the Dagorlads, nearing the\ngates of Mordor. We had managed a breech in the forces and fought\npast. Our hold was precarious at best, and all knew that our\nadvantage would be short-lived if we did not act quickly. There was\nlittle that stood between us and the gated wall, which had been\nbroken in an earlier attack. But there was no time to regroup our\nthoughts and strategize the best plan. A strike had to be made.\nPerhaps in hindsight it might have been better to retreat, knowing we\nhad wounded our enemy rather than to go blindly into the damning hell\nthat we did.   \" You should know\nthat Gil-Galad was a most valiant king. His words had power, and few\never disagreed with his counsel. And Oropher too was an elf of strong\nmeans. His only failing was that he demanded clear understanding. He\ncould be a magnificent ally when given so, for when he learned of all\nnuances to a plot, his mind was very quick. He could see what others\nmight never think to ask and make suggestions that drew a plan to\nnigh perfection. He was very cunning. Yet if information was lacking,\nhe would hesitate or was prone to err, for always was he thinking\nahead and trying to find the greatest solution.   \" Such was the case\non that fated day. Gil-Galad sent word for Oropher to attack on the\nleft flank at the time when the moon was cresting the horizon. He had\na diversion planned for the same moment at the middle reaches of the\nenemy front but he had not told my father what he would do. Instead\nall we were told was the attack point and the time.    \" But Oropher was\nwary. He knew that flying demons had been seen in the sky and the\nNazgul, the most potent of Sauron's defenses, had taken to wing. He\nsaw a gathering of them before our forces, in the place that we were\nto attack. But more, he knew nothing of the diversion Gil-Galad had\nplanned. He was not aware that at the appointed time, winged fighters\nof our own -- the Eagles -- were to come and engage in battle with\nthe Nazgul menace. He only had knowledge enough to see if he\nfollowed orders as given he was dooming his men to certain death.   \" But thinking\nthis, he thought perhaps if he acted before the given time, our\narmy's attack would draw the Nazgul away enough that the second\nwave could vanquish their foe.    \" And so he ordered\nus to the middle fore and we fought there.   \" It was a fatal\nerror. Though we did break up the Nazgul dominance, the Eagles were\nforced to attack at the left instead of the center as planned. The\nbigger mistake though was that the charge never reached the breach.   \" But a bit of\ntrickery was revealed to us, and we can take it as a spoil of war,\neven if it cost us our king. For it was Oropher who heard it; he was\nthere when the Witch King came to battle and he was the one who\nengaged in the attack that unveiled this evil.   \" We fought side by\nside with men in that war, and in that particular fight they too\nbroke their lines and came to our aid. Their forces meshed with ours,\nand we stood together in battle. But Angmar, the Witch King, came as\nwell and that changed that dynamics of our war. It is said that the\nNazgul strike such terror in the hearts of men that they will\ncollapse from the horror alone. It is also said that no man can bear\nthe presence of more than one Wraith at a time. Those words are false\nfor I saw Men fight those demons. Some shrank away in the shadow of\ntheir coming, but those with valiant hearts persevered and challenged\nthe Black Guards. Yet for all their courage, none could strike them\ndown.   \" One man -- his\nname was never known to me -- used whatever advantage he had in the\nchaos of battle, and he struck the Witch King through the heart with\nhis blade. It was the first time any had made such a strike and for a\nmoment all the battle seemed to come to a halt. There was dead\nsilence as the knife stuck. And then the Nazgul screamed, and it\nsounded like all the mercy of this world had been vanquished. Such\nterror did that din bring! All eyes were drawn there. But there was\nhope in the gazes, for it seemed an impossible task had been done:\nAngmar had been delivered a fatal blow.    \" It was not to be\nthough. No sooner had the Wraith cry ended did the man who had cut\nthrough him fall to the ground. He was a lifeless heap. And then\nworse than the Nazgul scream came the Nazgul's laugh. The demon was\nnot dead. The blade fell to the ground beside the dead man's body,\nand the Witch King taunted, 'Foolish Mortal! No Man shall ever have\nthe power to kill me!'   \" Those words are\nwhat rallied my father, for he ran into the event and took up the\nman's sword. 'No Man may do this thing, but I am not Man!' he\nsaid.    \" For a moment the\nWitch King looked as if to flee. Once more he screamed his deafening\nshriek but Oropher did not retreat. And then he took up his weapon\nand hissed, 'Try then, little Elf! But do not be sure of yourself\nfor my attention is on you and your kind.'   \" Oropher fought\nand the war around them suddenly raged again. Had I been near enough,\nI would have joined in my father's fight, for I too saw his\nmeaning. Elves had the power to slay that evil. It had been told in\nthat small show of fear from the Witch King. Man may not do this\nthing, but all that are not man may. And in knowing that, the Nazgul\nwould not be complacent in their battle with the elves. Angmar fought\nwith precision. And my father was cut down... cut down before I could\ncome to his side. When I finally did reach him, I carried him away\nfrom that damnation. He died in my arms that night.\"    Silence fell over\nthe group and Thranduil waited for them to recover before he spoke\nagain. Finally he said, \"The Nazgul are a terrible enemy to us,\nfrom that day to the present. They know we have the power to destroy\nthem. But since that day they have been wary of us; they will not\nallow any to get near enough to pierce their hearts.\"   \" I shall be the\none to do it,\" one elf in the group called out, laughing.     And others joined in\nthe sudden exuberance of this brag. \"Nay, it will be my sword that\nstrikes.\"   \" Nay, mine.\"    And so it went on,\nbut Thranduil silenced them with his raised hands. They needed to\nlearn the caveat of this secret. \"Do not be keen on this venture,\nfor if you have not known what may come of such an occurrence it is\ntime you did. Even for elf-kind, the strike of a Nazgul's blade can\ncause death... or worse.\"   \" What is worse?\"\nasked the nearest elf, making it clear he did not know.   \" If a Nazgul blade\nshould strike through the heart, and even a mere sliver of that\nweapon remains, the victim could fall into the clutches of evil. He\nor she could also become like that of the Wraith. Their body would\nsuccumb to the darkness and their faer would be lost to the healing\nof Mandos.\" Thranduil watched as some of those closest him\nshuddered, despite the heat of the fire. \"Do not be eager to\nsacrifice yourself unless you are prepared to lose everything,\" he\nwarned.    No one said\nanything, and Thranduil was glad to see the competition among them\nhad ended. Though the Nazgul were a horrible menace to the wood, he\nwould not let his warriors think they were invulnerable. He shrugged,\ntrying to lighten the mood. \"Of course it makes it hard to weigh\nsuch a choice when the Nazgul do not venture to the challenge. They\nhave not been seen in the last hundred years at least.\"    A cold chuckle ran\nthrough the group. \"Cowards,\" someone murmured in a low voice.    Legolas spoke then,\nadding his part to the grim determination of this cluster. \"Still\nthey remain. They hold up in their tower. The feel of them pervades\nthat ground.\" And among them he was the only one who would know for\nhe had ventured far in his fight against the darkness.    From the gathering\ncame the question, \"Is it true that Angmar has fled to the south?\"    Another chimed in,\n\"I had heard he no longer lives in the towering heights of Dol\nGuldur.\"    Legolas responded.\n\"I have heard it said too, and also that it is one named Kamul who\nrules there now. I think it makes little difference though for the\nfate of all the Wraiths is the same.\"   \" So they may all\nbe slain in the same way?\"    \" I believe it\ntrue,\" Legolas said.    A younger elf among\nthem then spoke. \"My sister used to sing a song to me of Amon Lanc,\nbefore it was the sinister place that it is now. She said it was\nlovely and strange and she used to go there as a child.\"   \" Sing it to us,\nAthedon,\" he was urged, and Thranduil smiled at the youth's\noptimism. He was equally pleased by the elf's voice, for it was\nclear and unshaken; it had the power to strip away the darkness.\nThranduil admired the gift.    The singing of one\nsong led to another, and soon the mood had changed and the warriors\nno longer exchanged tales of their terrible foes but of happier times\nand merriment. Thranduil used this as an excuse for his retirement.\nTo his surprise he found Legolas rising to leave as he did.   \" I will follow\nyou,\" the younger said.    \" How strange to\nfind you weary,\" the king remarked. Legolas had much vim in his\nquest for life and he seldom saw the younger fatigue.   \" It is more an\nexcuse for a private moment between us than any need for rest,\"\nLegolas explained.   \" Oh? What might\nyou seek?\" Thranduil asked.    \" Only confirmation\nof my own suspicions,\" the fair elf said. \"I too have heard\ntales, and one that distracts me though I have never heard it said by\nyou.\"   \" And that tale\nwould be...?\" he prompted.   \" That there is\nmore to Oropher's death than just a fatal wound.\"    Thranduil lowered\nhis gaze. \"A fatal wound is not sufficient?\"   \" I had heard he\nfell under circumstances such as those you described,\" Legolas\nhinted.    Thranduil paused. He\nhad dreaded this moment, though he knew Legolas would eventually\npiece it together. He never told the tale of Oropher's end without\ngiving warning of what a Morgul Blade might do as well. \"Such as\nsuccumbing to the poison at the end of a Nazgul knife?\"   \" Aye. I speak of\nwhat comes in a Wraith's existence. Is it true? Was that his fate?\"\nthe young elf asked, his eyes following the king.    The guilt of this\nconfession hurt more than Thranduil could have expressed. \"It is\ntrue,\" he finally said. \"Oropher was doomed by a blade to his\nheart. He fell to the curse.\"    There was a long\nsilence as the younger elf's had dipped and his face was shadowed\nby a curtain of hair. He finally spoke though his words came as a\nwhisper. \"I thought it so though you never spoke of it to me.\"    The elder sighed.\nBecause of the pain he suffered each time he thought on it, he had\nlong refrained from relaying this part of the tale. \"I granted him\na merciful death,\" he said, wishing he could believe it. He then\nadded, \"By my own knife I ended what he was to become.\"    In the distance,\nThranduil could hear his warriors yet singing their songs, and it\nseemed an odd contrast to think of his father's death while hearing\nthose merry tunes.    And in the corner of\nhis eye he could see the ghost that had haunted him ever since and\nhis heart twisted in pain.    He did not wait for\nLegolas to ask him more. He could not take the misery this\nrecollection brought him. Mechanically he put words to what happened\nwhile in his heart he was writhing with pain. \"We could not know at\nfirst the effect the wound would have, for none of us had thought it\npossible an elf could be turned from his nature into that of a\nWraith. But swiftly into that night the wound became ruined in black\nand my father's losing battle was clear. The villainous wound was\nconsuming him, and I watched helplessly as it tried to take his soul.   \" I wept for him,\nfor I did not know what I might do. But he supplied the answer to me,\njust as he always had.   \"' Kill me,\nThranduil,' he begged me in one of his few lucid moments. The dark\nwound had driven him into maddening dreams and cries of sorrow. But\nhis eyes had opened, and he called out for an end. 'My soul is lost\nto me,' he said. 'Make it end here so that I still might journey\ninto Mandos' care. It is not too late.'   \" I shook my head,\nfinding what he was asking impossible to do. Kill my own father? Such\nwas the crime of Kin-Slayers. It was not in me.    \" Yet I saw the\nwicked darkness that was taking him away. His eyes were changed --\nhad been changing ever since the attack -- and the wound stood\noutlined where the poison had seeped in. It crawled over his skin and\na transparency was beginning to seize him.   \"' Kill me,' he\nsaid again. I did not wish it, but if he asked it I would grant him\nanything. Still I did not know how I was to achieve this request.   \" He seemed to read\nmy mind, and without realizing his reach, I heard the swift ring of\nmy long knife being pulled from its sheath.    \" Kill me before I\nuse this to kill you,' he said, and I could see he had my weapon\npoised to do exactly that. There was menace in his eyes and I did not\nknow him in that instant. He was a demon. But his hand relaxed and he\nplaced the knife into mine. 'Do it,' he said, not bothering to\nexplain more. 'Now.' It was a command -- his last one to me.\"   \" You killed him,\"\nLegolas whispered, shock clearly written in his expression.   \" Had there been\nany other option I would not have considered his death.\"   \" But he was your\nfather,\" Legolas choked.   \" I will not lie --\nit hurt beyond anything I might have imagined! But I also knew it was\nthe right thing to do.\"    The younger elf said\nnothing, feeding into the guilt that seemed painted over Thranduil's\nfeeble excuse. His son seemed struck by the revelation and his eyes\nwere wide and filled with something of panic.    \" You see now why I\ncould not reveal this to the men,\" Thranduil said trying to make\nlight of the situation and speaking only consolingly.     Legolas looked up.\nHe swallowed and nodded. \"You were right.\"    Thranduil was\ngladdened by his son's reprieve. He clapped a hand to Legolas'\nshoulder. \"Aye. They would not have understood.\"   \" Nay, not that.\"\nNow Legolas mirrored his father's stance putting out a hand to the\nolder elf. \"I mean that you were right to have ended Oropher's\nlife,\" Legolas said, then lowered his gaze. Quietly he added, \"It\nwas what he asked of you. There was no hope beyond that act. It was\nfor his salvation. I would have asked the same of you were I in his\nposition.\"    It choked Thranduil\nto imagine such a thing, but he nodded. Their eyes met but he could\nnot read what was in his son's mind. He only knew he could never\nrepeat that action again. The guilt of it would surely kill him.    \"He understood,\"\nthe ghost of Oropher said, waking Thranduil from his reverie.  For a moment, Thranduil\nforgot that the specter had been near and had been doggedly haunting\nhim in recent days.  No others could see or\nhear the spirit; it seemed Oropher was Thranduil's personal\nphantom.  At least , thought Thranduil,  he is a benevolent\nghost  for he always appeared when the king's sense of doubt was\ngreatest. It was an irritant having a specter following you when your\npain was greatest, but at the same time he helped Thranduil gauge\nmoments when he needed to assert himself. Fear was as a constant\ncompanion in these dark times, and Thranduil was certain that was why\nthe ghost remained at his side now.  \"He will understand,\"\nOropher said. Thranduil blinked, trying to read the meaning in the\nshift of phrase.  The king looked where\nhis father directed. Legolas' brow was fevered still and his breath\nnow quaked as if he was bitterly cold.  \"Legolas,\" he\nwhispered once more as a means to sooth, but the elf's answer was\nonly a moan.  \"He will understand,\"\nthe ghost repeated. Oropher was staring at something about Legolas.  Thranduil followed his\ngaze and noticed that blood seeped from the bandage wrapped around\nLegolas' chest. And then he gasped.  Was it...?  The stain on the\nbandage was black, not red.  With shaking fingers,\nhe brushed the skin on Legolas' chest. Was he seeing it? Black\nveins were becoming visible beneath the pale surface.  \"He will ask for his\ndeath. You will see.\"  Without thinking, he\nbacked away from the bed. \"Calonin!\" Thranduil called for the\nhealer, wishing his reason for panic confirmed.  \"He will understand\nwhy you must kill him,\" Oropher said.  \"Calonin!\"\nThranduil called again for the healer, running to the door. He gazed\noutside into the darkened hall. No one was there.  \"Legolas,\" he\ngasped as he raced back to the bed. He began shaking his son to wake.\nHe had to see his eyes. \"Please!\" he begged. Tears filled his\neyes and he sobbed. He could see the evil leeching into his son's\nsoul. \"I can not do this again.\"  Oropher watched Legolas\nas well. His eyes remained fixed, as if he willed a change to occur\nthere.  Legolas was shaking\nuncontrollably and he cried out as if in pain. The king could not\nhelp his fears. \"Calonin!\" he tried one last time though his\nvoice was weak. He no longer needed the healer to tell him. It was\nreal!  \"He understood what\nyou did for me because I asked it of you. If it is to be, Legolas\nwill ask it of you too,\" Oropher said.  He was choking. His\nbreath would not come past his tears. \"I cannot!\"  \"You did it for me,\"\nthe ghost reminded, but the words seemed almost a taunt. \"You\ngranted me mercy.\"  \"Why do you do this\nto me?\" Thranduil cried, suddenly enraged. \"Why do you offer me\nguilt? You are to be my better self,\"  \"What makes you think\nthat?\" Oropher replied. A chill ran down Thranduil's spine.  But his attention was\ndrawn away as Legolas moaned once again. The elf's eyelids\nfluttered and Thranduil was there. His hands were on either side of\nhis son's face. Blue eyes opened.  The voice was a\nwhisper. \"Father,\" the young elf blindly called out.  He grasped his son's\nhand in both of his, stroking, trying to ease any pain. \"I am\nhere,\" he gently said, his voice consoling.  The elf's eyes were\nlost, searching. \"The knife!\" Legolas sobbed.  Thranduil's brow\nfurrowed. \"What knife?\"  \"Your knife,\" he\nsaid and he continued to seek out his father. He cried out\ndesperately.  \"Legolas, look at\nme!\" Thranduil called, shaking the elf slightly. Their eyes met.\nWas it there? Was he seeing what he had seen in his father's eyes\nall those years ago? \"I cannot do this. Do not ask it of me.\"  But the knife was\nthere, being handed to him over Legolas' body. Oropher held it.\nThranduil had not even heard it being drawn from its sheath.  \"Use it,\" Legolas\nsaid, looking past his father to the ghost. It suddenly dawned on\nThranduil that Legolas could see Oropher.  Thranduil looked from\nhis son to the ghost then back again. \"No! You are wrong!\" But\nthe veins around the chest wound were darkening, spreading.  \"You wished it upon\nhim,\" Oropher pressed.  \"Why would I wish\nsuch a thing?\" Thranduil objected.  \"You want to kill\nhim,\" Oropher accused.  \"No!\" Thranduil\ncried, panic seizing his heart. But somehow in the deep recesses of\nhis mind he knew he had been expecting the wound to go black. He had\nbeen waiting for this moment to come. Yet he certainly did not want\nit!  Suddenly, Legolas'\nhand was clutching at his father's chest. \"Slay me!\"  \"No!\" Thranduil\nshouted, trying to pull away.  The young elf hissed.\n\"Do it before I turn upon you.\" Eyes met eyes and Thranduil\nrealized new panic. It was true. Legolas' eyes were different! They\nwere changed! Before him, Legolas was transforming into a Wraith!  With a sob, he grabbed\nthe knife. He felt a kinship with the balance of the tool as his\nfingers curled around the handle. He lifted it. He knew his face to\nbe a terror as he poised the weapon over his son's heart.  But the balance was\nlost as he looked into his son's face. For an instant, Legolas\nappeared composed, relaxed... normal. And then the monster presence\nwas back and he saw the demon curse altering his son. Which was real?\nHe could not tell! His hands shook with his uncertainty.  \"Kill me,\" Legolas\nsaid in a voice that was a poisonous hiss. Blue fingers with\nblackened nails reached up to the knife and pulled at the blade.\n\"Kill me!\" Legolas repeated.  But Thranduil's eyes\ncould not maintain any certainty. The vision of his son kept\nshifting. In a blink, Legolas was at peace, gentle and sleeping, in\nthe next he was a demon, an advocate for death. \"Which are you?\"\nhe cried, pulling his hands to his chest and shrinking to his fear.\nWas madness claiming him?  \"You choose,\"\nOropher whispered, and Thranduil looked up to the ghost. \"Choose\nfor him just like you chose for me.\" And with this Thranduil saw\nhis father's features change as well. Eyes glowed a piercing red\nwhile only a shadow of his elven form remained. The body twisted and\ngrew taller while a new sense of evil annihilated anything fair.  And below, Legolas\nsnarled, pulling at Thranduil's hands, reaching for his chest.\nDemons were all around him and he quailed in answer to Oropher's\nghost. \"You asked it of me! You begged me to end it!\" Thranduil\ncried. The knife was shaking furiously in his hand.  \"Did I? Or was my\nplea only in your mind?\" the ghost asked, hovering at his ear.  \"You asked it of me!\"\nThranduil claimed. Oropher had demanded his death.  Or had he?\nHe could no longer be sure. The weight of his guilt was sapping his\nstrength.  \"Kill me!\" Legolas\nmoaned again. His hands weakly reached to the king, as if he were\npleading for this mercy.  \"Do it!\" Oropher\ndemanded. \"Now!\"  And then Legolas'\nmovements were no longer enfeebled. There was strength in his grip\nand he was fighting for the knife.  \"This is your only\nchance,\" Oropher urged as Legolas' hands curled on the handle in\nthe effort to turn the blade. He was turning it and now its point was\ndirected at Thranduil's heart!  Legolas was going to\nkill him! \"No!\" he exclaimed as he found his own control over the\nblade. He did not wish to die!  \"Grant him mercy!\nGrant him peace! End his misery! Do what you did for me!\" Oropher\nshouted as Thranduil and the Wraith form fought for the knife. The\nweapon was a looming threat to Thranduil's life.  \"I do not want this!\"\nhe shouted. He did not think he could live with the knowledge that he\nhad taken the life of his kin  again ! It was too much for him!  \"I cannot help you if\nyou would take this upon yourself! Examine what is before you! Will\nhis death really be that of your making? Was mine?\" Oropher argued.  \"Why do you not help\nme, Father? I need you!\" Thranduil cried. Tears were blinding him,\nand he truly could not see who or what it was he fought.  \"I help you, but you\nmust recognize the truth for yourself. Answer my query and end the\nbattle you wage. You think yourself a murderer!\"  It was true! All along,\nThranduil had kept from putting a name to his guilt, but that is what\nhe felt. He had murdered!  \"Admit as much!\"\nOropher urged.  \"Yes!\" Thranduil\nwailed. The admission was as painful as the death he had inflicted\nand new tears spilled from his eyes.  \"But can it be\nmurder, Thranduil, if it was asked for?\" the ghost asked.  \"I did not want it! I\ncould have chosen otherwise!\"  \"And had you?\" his\nfather continued.  And had he his father\nwould have become a monster of the darkness, his soul lost, his song\nsevered, not even relinquished to the healing cares of an elf's\ngreater fate. \"But I know this!\" he cried, finding the question\nfutile and unredeeming.  \"Do you think I did\nnot?\" Oropher then asked.  Thranduil had to pause,\nand his fight with the evil seemed to slacken. \"You would not have\nasked,\" he suddenly grasped. \"You would not have asked if the\ndarkness was not claiming you!\" Thranduil cried as he justified the\nactions fully in his mind.  And then he realized a\ntruth that had not been availed to him before. Oropher had loved life\nas much as Legolas did. He would not relinquish to death if he were\nnot changed. It was the demon that had claimed his father and it was\nthat demon that had begged for an end. And realizing that, he knew\nOropher had already been beyond the pale reaches of life. Guilt was\nunfounded for him because all Oropher had wanted was to hold to life\nin whatever form it might take. The mercy had been real, for what\nmore could be given when life no longer remained.  \"There! There!\"\nOropher exclaimed, drawing Thranduil back to his task as he took\ncontrol. The knife once more was directed over the black spot that\nmarked Legolas' heart.  With one last breath,\nhe looked into the eyes of the monster beneath him, trying\ndesperately to find something of his son there. He could see once\nmore, but haloed orbs of red were the only things visible to him, and\nhe knew in that instant his son was gone.  \"Forgive me, please,\"\nhe said as an oath, \"Be free from this agony. Were you my son, I\nwould not do this. But you ask... you ask, and I cannot doubt that to\nmean that my son is destined for salvation. Were you Legolas, the\nwound I inflict would mean nothing.\" He plunged the knife into the\nmonster's chest.  And then he screamed.  Pain suddenly filled\nhim in a torrent so unexpected and real he could only find it in him\nto howl in tortured suffering. The agony shook him, filling his\nchest, his lungs, seizing all of his strength. He looked down. The\nknife was impaled within his own chest.  Weakly he lifted his\nhands there, feeling the blood that sprang from the now prominent\nhole. He did not know how such a wound came to be. The knife had been\nturned on the monster, not him.  So why was it  his\nblood that spilled crimson past his fingers, over his garments, onto\nthe blankets?  \"I want to live,\"\nhe gasped feeling his life slipping away though he fought to keep it.  He wanted to live but\nhe was falling, falling into arms that reached out to grab him, to\nclaim him, to protect him. And then he realized that he need not\nfear. This wound would not see him dead though he felt utmost\ncertainty that the demon of guilt was now gone.  Silence vanquished his\nwar.  oOoOoOoOoOo  Legolas' eyes came to\nfocus as he lifted his head from the bed. He had not meant to sleep,\nbut somehow he had. The athelas had had a calming effect, and had\nmanaged to lull him into a drowse.  He reached a hand down\nto his father, who was resting peacefully, brushing his fingertips\nover the elf's cheek.  \"How do you fare,\nLegolas?\" Calonin asked as he approached the bed.  \"I am well,\"\nLegolas answered the healer. And then he added, \"The fever has\nbroken.\" He rested the back of his hand on Thranduil's brow.  \"The worst seems to\nbe passed,\" the healer said as he began work on the dressing that\nprotected Thranduil's wound. \"He is healing well.\"  Legolas nodded, pleased\nto hear what he already had affirmed in his mind. \"It was a\ndifficult night,\" he said, recalling his father's cries and\nwrithing torment. He had spent the better part of it trying to sooth\nthe elf king, to placate his frenzied panic after the nightmare of\nthe battle. Tough decisions had been forced upon him, and for the\nbetter part he had been unsure, for he saw signs that things were\nturning a darker way. Until his waking, he had been uncertain if\nThranduil was falling to the same fate  his  father had\nsuccumbed.  But the demon had never\nappeared. Thranduil had never cried out for his death and Legolas\nattributed that much to the strength of the elf. According to\nCalonin, the curse of the Black Breath had been responsible for much\nof what his father had endured, for the injury had not been fatal.\nBut that did not mean Thranduil could not succumb to the doom of\nfading. If his father had thought himself beyond hope, the wound\ncould have killed him whether it was tainted or not.  Fortunately that had\nnever happened, and despite the nightmares his father fought through,\nhe had struggled in favor of life.  \"Legolas?\" the\nhealer called. He lifted a long knife lying at Thranduil's side.\n\"How did this get here?\"  \"What is it?\" the\nelf asked, uncertain what it was the healer held.  \"It is Thranduil's\nknife, I think. How did it get here?\" Calonin asked, his brow\nperplexed.  \"I do not know,\"\nLegolas answered, thrown uncertain by the appearance of a weapon that\nhad not been present when last he was aware. He then added, \"I have\nnever seen that knife in my life. Are you sure it is my father's?\"  \"I know it,\"\nCalonin admitted, turning the knife over in his hands, \"but I have\nnot seen it for many a long year.\"  \"What do you mean?\"\nasked Legolas, confused. He knew his father's weapons. \"Where do\nyou know it from?\" He reached for the weapon and ran his fingers\nover the inlay on the handle.  \"He carried it with\nhim into the battle before the gates of Mordor,\" Calonin replied.  \"You mean in the\nengagement where Oropher fell?\" Legolas asked, truly mystified now.\nWas this the knife that his father had used to do that horrible deed?  \"It was lost to him\nshortly after the siege,\" the older elf nodded.  \"When he granted his\nmercy upon my grandfather,\" Legolas murmured, not truly asking. He\nknew the healer perceived his meaning.  \"Aye,\" the healer\nsaid, bowing his head in remembrance of that sorrowful event. \"But\nhow did it get here? That is what I wish to know, for it was lost to\nhim shortly after. None could find it. I remember because he wished\nit to be buried with Oropher.\"  \"Perhaps one of the\nwarriors brought it in while we slept,\" Legolas offered. \"I know\nmany have fought with my father since those days, and though I would\nnever think any would steal, it may have been recovered here, on the\ngrounds of the old palace.\"  But the healer shook\nhis head. \"This weapon is not tarnished. It has been well-tended.\nFurther, I stood at the door all night should you have needed me.\nNone came into this room after the athelas was steeped.\"  Legolas was confounded.\nHe had no idea where the knife had come from. But he realized he\ncould not be distracted by such mysteries. He shrugged, placing the\nknife upon the table near his father's bed as he said, \"I imagine\nhe will be pleased to learn it has been returned to him. Let us leave\nit at that.\"  The healer nodded, and\nthat said everything in Legolas' mind. His father was better. He\nwould recover. And that was all that mattered.  He squeezed Thranduil's\nhand in a further sign of encouragement. And then he turned back to\nCalonin. \"I must see to my men,\" he said, excusing himself so the\nhealer might attend to his duties. The warriors around the camp had\nwaited the night to learn what they might, and now that the horror\nwas past, he felt comfortable reporting the news to them that their\nking would live.  He entered the darkened\nhall outside the healing room and walked the corridor toward the\nyard. As he pushed the door open, morning light blinded him briefly.\nSquinting into the glare, a movement in the shadows caught his eye.\nHe turned, and for a fragment of a moment he saw a figure there. It\nwas an elf, tall, lean, fair of face and color. It struck Legolas\nthat the elf seemed familiar to him.  And then he blinked and\nthe elf was gone. Legolas frowned, uncertain if a figment of his mind\nhad tried to fool him.  But he let it go, just\nas he let the knife go. Evil touched too much of his world to let the\nwhims of burdened thoughts rule him. There was life to live after\nall, and for all the darkness, that gave him -- his father -- all the\nelves -- hope. That was what had import on this day. He took a step\ninto the light.   THE END"}

Red hair fell down her back as she absentmindedly brushed it off her face. Sitting down, she opened her word program and began typing, her fingers softly tapping against the keyboard.   The girl was Lina Holling, one of many, many LotR addicts and fanfic writers.\nImagine\u2026  Space. Darkness scattered with small dots of light everywhere. They may seem small in this great nothingness, like the occasional oases in a huge desert, far in between. But they are beautiful, their light travelling far, far, far\u2026\nImagine\u2026  One of these stars. It is not one of the biggest, or one of the smallest, it shines faithfully like it has done since the day it came about. Around this stars circles several planets, and one of them has life.

Mashes, snow clad mountains, forests, plains; a huge variety of living conditions. And everywhere there is life.  Imagine\u2026\nHumans. Elves. Dwarves. Dragons. Haflings. Orcs. Demons. Wizards. In a world like this, magic does not only exist, but thrives.\nImagine\u2026  The magic. Every stone, every three, every lake, every river, every sunrise, every cloud, every sunset - magic. Not magic as we know it, but magic in the very existence.   Imagine\u2026\n  This wonderful world, so pure, so unspoiled\u2026\nHold on. Something seems to be wrong, it seems there is a.. A gate? A locked gate. It has a sign on it.\n\"You cannot pass \u2013 until you have passed.\"\nWhat the\u2026?   Lina blinked, her gaze fixed on the screen. Surely she had not just written that? Not, she had to have dozed off and\u2026\n  A discreet cough made her look up at the three suits who seemed to suddenly appeared in her bedroom. For a moment she wondered if she were hallucinating, especially when the nearest man gave her a huge, somewhat creepy smile.\n\"Trying to write a LotR fanfic were you? Sorry, no can do. Party's over. What, you didn't really think we'd let this go on, did you?\"\n\"Huh?\" Lina managed to croak out, wondering if the tic tacs she had eaten by some weird accident had been replaced with ecstasy or something else trippy.  \"Ah, it will all become clear to you. I am One, this is Two and Three. Think of us as\u2026 Representatives of Middle-earth.\"\n\"Middle-earth?\" the girl echoed, and in her head a little voice muttered sarcastically. 'You've finally snapped' it muttered. 'Had to happen.'\n  The man was still smiling, the kind of smile that is meant to be reassuring but really just creeps you more out.\n\"Never mess with a land where magic exists,\" the man went on. Then he took a deep breath and launched into what had to be a pre-planned speech. \"But do not despair. You can still write fanfic. All you have to do is enrol and pass The Official Fanfiction University of Middle-earth.

Our esteem teaching staff also includes other well-known residences of Middle-earth. Upon successful completion you will be given a licence to write LotR fanfic. All clear?\"\nLina opened her mouth, but closed it again. She had no idea what to say.\n  \"Good. I'm sure you'll find it\u2026 Stimulating.\" If it was possible, the man seemed to smile even wider. Reaching into his briefcase, he took out a few papers and a folder.  \"This is your official enrolment papers. Your ride will arrive tomorrow, if you should chose to enrol, and I'm confident you will. If not\u2026Oh, no need for that, I'm sure you'll come aboard. Good luck miss!\"  The folder was pressed into her hand, and gaping Lina watched the three vanish in the blink of an eye, leaving only scattered papers on the floor. She blinked, and blinked again. The folder was still in her hands, and it felt real. It was real.\n\"Oh. My. God,\" she muttered, flipping through the folder. \"I'm mad. I'm truly gone mad. This cannot.. 'Platonic Love 101.

Oh my.\"\n  She stared at the papers on the floor. Legolas as a lecturer \u2013 now there was a hallucination worth having. What harm could it do to fill them out, right? She was just hallucinating, so it wouldn't lead to anything. Right?\n  To her surprise, her hand trembled when she reached for the papers. They seemed standard enough, except for a few odd questions.\n  \"Fear of spiders Yes/No,\" she read. \"Chosen side Evil/Good.

Yup, a dream.\n  Laughing, she left the filled out papers on the desk and slipped into bed. The soft covers greeted her, and she hardly noticed that the computer seemed to have turned itself off and that the papers had vanished the moment she had let go of them.  Soon she slept, the last sleep she would have in her world for quite some time, for the next morning she awoke in Rohan Riding Express Carriage headed for The Official Fanfiction University of Middle-earth in the city of Minas Tirith.  Her screams echoed all the way to Rivendell."}

King Dain Ironfoot responded by mustering his army, and joined Brand, who had been pushed back to the Mountain's feet. Seeing the host set upon them, and sensing the battle would not go well, Dain acted upon a strange urge. As the dwarves forged into the foray, joining the Men of Dale in their bloody battle, a lone envoy spurred his pony into a gallop, hurrying towards the distant tree line of Mirkwood. Dain wished him all speed and that his mission be successful.  The fighting was fierce. Dain kept an eye open for any sign of relief, hoping against hope that help might come. It was a fool's hope, he knew, and yet, even as he pulled his axe from the body of another slain Easterling, he searched the distant horizon. Instead, what he saw caused his heart to sink.  The trees were burning. Mirkwood was aflame!  \"The trees!\" someone cried above the clash of weapons and screams of the dying. \"Mirkwood burns!\"  Smoke rose over the distant trees, wispy and scattered over various parts of the wood, then darkening the skies even to a few leagues of where Dain knew the Elvenking's Halls could be found. And it was then Dain knew that there would be no aid from the elves; and as sure as he knew that, he knew before the battle's end that he would breathe his last.  With a grim smile, he lifted his axe once more with the thought that though he might meet his end here, he would take as many enemy heads with him as he could. With a loud bellow, Dain added his voice to the cacophony of sound. \"Baruk Kaz\u00e2d! Khaz\u00e2d ai-m\u00eanu!\""}

The day was cool, for the previous week had been filled with rain, and the waters of the Forest River were swollen with the extra runoff from upstream. Mirkwood's king stood at the neck of his large bay charger, and his attendants, likewise waited beside their mounts. A troop of foot soldiers stood at attention, ready to guard the king and his party on their eastward journey. All was in readiness, save for the missing riders of a small dappled pony and a brown palfrey, which were being held by two impassive grooms.  A courtier sighed discreetly. The brown mare began to nibble the sleeve of the elf who held her bridle, and the pony broke wind.  \"Galion,\" said the king, turning to his valet and erstwhile esquire. \"Would you be so kind as to go see what is delaying Saerlin and the prince?\"  \"As you wish, Sire.\" Long years of seeing to the needs of his royal master had invested Galion with an abnormally restrained demeanor and an increasing love of strong drink. He crossed the stone bridge over the river, spoke the secret password that opened the stone gates into the mountainside and entered the palace. To reach the prince's chamber Galion had to first pass through a large reception hall, off which many public rooms, including Thranduil's throne room, branched. He went up a broad stairway whose stone balusters were carved into the shape of twisting tree limbs, down a carpeted hall, and then up another staircase. Burning torches set into elaborate sconces lit his way. As he went, he turned into progressively narrower hallways and through modest doors that looked as if they might lead to the servants' wings. There was a method to this, for only those very familiar with the layout of the caves could find their way to the sleeping chambers of the king and his son.  He came to a room whose carved wooden door stood partially ajar, and he heard much what he had expected to hear: \"No! I will not!\"  \"You will, because I say you will.\"  \"No, I will not.\"  Galion shook his head and sighed. The first voice was that of Legolas, very young as yet by elvish reckoning and already exhibiting the same stubborn temperament as his royal sire, although Galion would never have dared to voice such an observation out loud. The second voice was that of his nursemaid, Saerlin, poor lady, and to Galion's ears she sounded as if she were nearing the end of her patience.  Not that her patience was in great supply under any circumstances. Saerlin had been married to a friend and fellow soldier of Galion's, one of those unfortunate elves who had not returned from the battle of the Dagorlad. Saerlin had never been gentle natured, and almost three thousand years of being deprived of the pleasures of the marriage bed before she'd had more than a short time to enjoy them had not sweetened her sour temper any further. One had to wonder why she had wished to take on the difficult task of being nursemaid to a motherless elf-child. Galion had a suspicion that she had done it in hopes of getting closer to the father of said child, and perhaps catching the monarch's eye. If so, Galion thought she was deluded, for Thranduil had not shown much interest in anyone other than his young son in the years since the death of his queen. Hence, more disappointment for poor Saerlin.  He took a deep breath for courage and entered the room. \"What seems to be the problem, Saerlin?\"  \"Prince Legolas refuses to put on his shirt of mail,\" the elf woman said between clenched teeth.  \"Indeed, my prince, what is this foolishness?\" Galion said briskly. \"You know it is your father's wish that you wear your mithril shirt whenever you journey outside the palace gates.\"  \"I don't care. It sets me apart and makes me look a fool,\" said Legolas, with a determination that surprised even Galion.  The article in question lay on the bed. It was a lovely piece of work, commissioned by Thranduil from the dwarves of Erebor when the prince was three years old, and Galion knew it had cost his king a small fortune. The neckline featured a yoke of vine filigree, and the belt was studded with pearls and crystal gems. Perhaps it was the gems. Knowing the Elvenking's fondness for white gemstones, the dwarvensmiths had thrown in the belt detail in hope of inspiring further business, but Galion had to admit it was a bit . . . much. Perhaps not for Thranduil, who cut a splendid figure in fine garments and enjoyed putting on a show for his subjects, but definitely for his more modest son. Who could have guessed that young Legolas would grow to have such a fierce dislike of ostentatious things?  \"You must put it on, Prince Legolas. The party is ready to depart and you cannot keep them waiting.\"  \"I will not put it on. It is too small for me.\"  \"How can that be? It still fits well across the chest.\"  \"Yes, but my arms have grown. My wrists stick out.\"  This was true, Galion thought. Already the boy was getting his growth. He shut his eyes, feeling the beginnings of a headache. The thought of a full-grown Legolas with his stubborn streak in full flower was almost too much to bear.  \"My prince, if you will not put on your chain mail and come down, I will be forced to bring your father up here to see that you do it.\"  \"Then bring him,\" said the child. Galion knew himself to be trumped.  Galion caught Saerlin's gaze, and the two rolled their eyes. \"Spoiled, spoiled, spoiled,\" said the woman's cornflower blue eyes. \"Just like his father,\" said the man's slate grey ones.  Back down the hallways he trudged and out of the gate, muttering to himself as he did so. Prince Legolas was not so much spoiled as he was overprotected. Galion could hardly blame his king for cosseting his one and only child, but he could also not fault the child for having the intelligence to sense it and rebel.  The king greeted him with a beatific smile. The courtiers, archers and grooms merely looked annoyed.  \"He won't put on his mithril shirt, Sire.\"  \"Is that so, Galion?\" said Thranduil. \"I suppose I must deal with it then.\" He nodded courteously to the waiting assembly, who had no choice other than to await his return with good grace no matter how long it took, and followed Galion back across the bridge.  \"You had children, Galion,\" Thranduil said softly to his valet as they went up the broad staircase. \"However did you deal with this sort of thing?\"  \"Their mother dealt with it, Sire,\" he said and regretted it as soon as the words were out, for he saw the look of pain flit across the king's face. \"You must also remember that my children were born in the early days when Lord Oropher first led us to Greenwood the Great and we dwelled upon Amon Lanc. There was no need for the young ones to be so closely guarded back then.\"  \"And now, The Necromancer dwells in that same spot, and his orcs fill these woods with their terror. I would like to give my son the freedom that once we had, but I dare not.\" Thranduil sighed. \"How strange life is, Galion. You and I are of an age, yet you are a grandsire many times over, while I am raising my first and only. And I am having quite a time of it.\"  The child was staring into his fireplace, ramrod straight and defiant, as monarch and valet entered. Saerlin bowed and fluttered her eyelashes and was completed ignored.  \"What's this I hear, my son? You have been looking forward to this journey to Dale for weeks. Surely you do not want to miss the celebration? Girion's youngest son is just your size. I hear he is looking forward to meeting you. Why will you not put on your armor? I would think that any young elf your age would delight in such a set of mail.\"  Galion, as ever, was amazed to see his Elven-lord deal with his child thus. Thranduil's temper had been forged before the Black Gates of Mordor and his own warriors trembled before him. Some of that patience would not go amiss with his courtiers, or even his valet, Galion thought, yet it seemed to be reserved for the child.  \"I want to go with you to Dale,  Ada . But I do not wish to look foolish. No other elf wears mail of mithril. Your archers wear armor of leather.\"  Galion saw the king tense ever so slightly. He had been his esquire at the battle of the Dagorlad, where too many Silvan warriors had fallen with their leather armor pierced by orcish arrows, while the hosts of Gil-galad had fared better in their metal gear. He had ridden at Thranduil's side on the sad journey home and been witness to his palpable grief at his inability to protect his warriors.  \"Legolas, there is a shadow on this wood, and the minions of The Enemy may attack at any time. You are a prince of your people and you must keep yourself safe. Just as I, their king, must keep myself safe.\"  \"Are you wearing mithril mail,  Ada ?\"  Galion saw Thranduil blink. \"You cannot see beneath my outer clothing, my son,\" he countered smoothly, with the guile that had made him the best negotiator east of the Misty Mountains.  \"May I wear my mail beneath my tunic, like you?\" Legolas asked.  \"Of course, as long as you wear it.\"  \"All right,  Ada .\" said Legolas meekly. Saerlin rushed forward to help the child out of his tunic, but Thranduil waved her off and began to undress his son himself. \"Why is King Girion celebrating,  Ada ?\"  \"It is the majority of his eldest son. Girion is very proud of his heir, and rightly so.\"  \"Majority? What is that?\" Legolas was down to his undershirt, and Thranduil began threading his arms through the mail shirt.  \"It is when a young male of the  Edain  reaches the age of twenty-one and his bones and muscles are set. When his body is strong enough to bear the weight of full armor and wield a sword he takes his place among the men.\"  \"Will I have a majority when I am twenty-one?\"  \"No, my son,\" Thranduil said, fastening the jeweled belt. \"That will not happen until you have fifty winters to your credit.\"  \"Why? Will I not be strong enough?\"  \"Put up your arms, Legolas, and let me put your tunic over your head. If you are anything like me you will have most of your full height by the time you are forty, but we Firstbornare different, and the requirements of adulthood are far more than bearing a sword. You have much more to learn before you can take your rightful place in our society. Far more than the  Edain .\"  \"It seems unfair.\"  \"Perhaps so, Legolas, but your body is made to last the ages of this earth and your mind along with it. At fifty, an  adan  is already feeling the weight of his years while you will be just beginning your life. They must hurry, because Eru's gift to Men takes them so soon. We, on the other hand, have all the time in the world.\"  Thranduil smoothed the tunic down his son's body and tied on his cloak. \"Is this good now?\"  Legolas nodded. 'Yes,  Ada .\" He put his small hand into his father's larger one, and the Elvenking and his son proceeded from the room.  oOo  The orcs attacked near the eastern edge of the forest where the Elf path ran along the river on a high, steep bank overlooking the rushing water. The first sign of trouble came when one of the foot soldiers pitched forward silently with an arrow through his neck. Within seconds the air was filled with the hiss of flying arrows, and black-clad orcs wearing the insignia of Dol Guldur began to swarm out of the trees. Thranduil and his mounted nobles drew their swords and charged in among the attackers, while the foot soldiers drew their bows and returned fire. The horses began to whinny and snort in the confusion.  \"Galion, protect the prince!\" Thranduil yelled, whirling his charger and trampling down an unlucky orc in his path. Galion reined his own horse around, just in time to hear Saerlin scream as an arrow hit Legolas in the center of his chest. The force of the blow knocked the child from his saddle, and he tumbled down the steep bank. Within moments his small form was lost to sight beneath the roiling currents of the Forest River. Thranduil, busy with two orcs who were jabbing at the chest and belly of his horse in an attempt to bring it down, did not see. Galion rode to his king and relieved one of the orcs of his head with a quick swipe of his sword, while Thranduil struck down the other.  \"My lord, quickly! \" Galion cried. By now the foot soldiers had managed to kill or chase off most of the orcs, and the mounted courtiers were making short work of the rest. Two more of the soldiers were dead, and one of the courtiers had an arrow in his leg.  Thranduil turned to see a pale and weeping Saerlin struggling to keep her palfrey from bolting, and then he stiffened as he spied the trembling and now riderless pony. He leaped from his horse and ran to her side. \"What happened? Tell me!\"  \"He was hit, Sire. He fell into the river,\" she wailed.  The Elvenking ran to the steep edge of the bank and picked up a spent orc arrow with the tip badly blunted.  \"His mail stopped the arrow, thank Elbereth,\" said Galion, reaching Thranduil's side. \"But he'll be badly stunned, perhaps knocked unconscious.\"  Thranduil ran back to his horse and swung into the saddle. \"S\u00e9regon, see to the dead and get the wounded back to the palace. Magorion needs a healer for that leg. And bring back as many elves as you can muster. We have to find my son.\" He kicked his horse and galloped off east, his eyes fixed on the river.  \"Ai! He's not watching where he's going,\" Galion muttered to himself, running to his own mount. \"He'll put that horse's foot in a rabbit hole and break his neck.\" He galloped after his king.  Galion caught up to his lord at the edge of the forest, where the river rounded a spit of rock and flowed out into the marshes. Past the forest wall, the river split off into a maze of smaller channels. If the child's body had been swept this far, and there had been no sign of him back along the banks, he could be in any one of those backwaters, hidden among the tall grass and poplars.  Thranduil stood staring silently to the east. His face, in profile, was eerily calm. Galion had seen that same stunned look once before, on the plains of the Dagorlad when Oropher had fallen within yards of the two of them.  \"My lord, S\u00e9regon is returning with help. We will find him.\"  Thranduil turned to him, his face blank. \"Yes. We will find him, if it takes me until the breaking of the world. We will find my son.\"   To be continued . . .    Translation:\n  Ada : Sindarin for Daddy   Author's Notes:  Here comes my customary note on elves and saddles. For those who will insist that elves never use saddles, I cite the following example of an elf using both saddle and bridle. The horse is Asfaloth; the rider is Glorfindel:   \"Suddenly into view below came a white horse, gleaming in the shadows, running swiftly. In the dusk its    headstall    flickered and flashed, as if it were studded with gems like living stars. ( . . .) the rider had    reined    in his horse and halted ( . . .)'You shall ride my horse,' said Glorfindel. 'I will shorten the    stirrups    up to the    saddle skirts   , and you must sit as tight as you can.\" Fellowship of the Ring, Chapter XII: Flight to the Ford   I am a horse owner and a rider myself. When I first wrote this tale, I envisioned Thranduil and his courtiers brushing horsehairs from the seats of their breeches upon their arrival at Dale, and I could not help thinking there was something wrong with the picture. In a subsequent story, an adult Legolas will exhibit his ability to ride without tack, but for now, the saddles are being used for pragmatic reasons."}

Homecoming\n Out of caution at what might yet lurk in the Woods despite its cleansing, and from desire to make faster time across open country, the unlikely pair passed up the eastern side of Mirkwood, now Eryn Lasgalen, toward Dale and Erebor, the Lonely Mountain, beyond\u2014each heading home. It had been almost six months since the Fellowship had finally disbanded at Isengard, and nearly one full change of seasons since the destruction of the One Ring and the end of the Dark Lord, Sauron. In those same weeks, the dwarf and elf had traveled together, fulfilling oaths made against hope in the midst of the War of the Ring\u2014each to accompany the other to his respective stone and wooden wonder, and there to share in it. From a tour of the Glittering Caves at Helm's Deep, they departed for a stay in Fangorn Forest as guests of its namesake eldest Ent. There they passed some time in the deepest parts of the oldest woods, and witnessed some secrets also of the roots of the Misty Mountains. After a brief return to Lorien, they crossed the River Anduin and viewed the ruined Dol Guldur\u2014once secret stronghold of the Necromancer, before he was revealed as Sauron and fled to Barad-d\u00fbr.  Visits and vistas had, they passed along the top of the Brown Lands, and turned north around the southern tip of Eryn Lasgalen. As had become their custom over this past year and some months, they rode and chatted together upon Arod, the gift of Rohan and their mount of many roads.  To their right, the plains of Rhovanion stretched far east, across the River Running and off into the expanse of Rh\u00fbn. It had been some time since either had seen these sights, though the views had varied little despite all that had passed in the world in the time between. To their left, however, the tall, bright elf noted for the smaller, ruddy dwarf how changed the forest seemed, with the Dark Lord defeated and his minions scared and scattered. Not so foreboding as before, though not yet friendly, the woods' edge drifted slowly past them through miles and hours, leagues and days\u2014tall, strong and constant.  At length the River and Woods turned toward one another, meeting just beyond the Old Forest Road, near the base of the woodland Mountains. Passing through this natural crossroads, and around the mountains' far side, Legolas Thranduilion drew back the reins sharply, cutting off Gimli Gl\u00f3inion in mid-yet-another-story and nearly spilling him from the steed. For on this side of the slopes, the strong forest suffered mightily, thinned by axe strokes, scarred by fire and littered with other mementos of war. No smoke rose from the ruins before them, but the scene and scent of battle, flame and death still hung heavy in the space.  Arod trod delicately into the charred forest-become-field, mottled by broken trunks and burned stumps. Many steps in, they stopped and dismounted for a somber rest. Legolas stooped to mourn the earth's injury, wondering what had become of his people. His distant kin at Caras Galadhon had shared little detail on how his home had fared on the northern front of the Ring War, saying only that the wounds ran deep in forest, folk and father, that autumn had fallen, and that, though spring approached for the wider world, no green leaf had yet to come to Mirkwood.  For his part, Gimli's message from the Lord and Lady of the Galadhrim was no more clear, speaking both of loss and of life at Erebor. And as loathe as he was to leave his beloved Lady, Gimli had consented to the difficult departure and both had made haste for home.  Seeing now the injury around him, Legolas all but wished he had remained in the ever-bloom of Lorien. As the dwarf lunched on lembas cakes packed for their final leg northward, the somber elf spoke words of healing over stump and sprig, and mourned this welcome home.  With condolences offered, and dwarf palate refreshed, they rode on toward the distant, surviving treeline. As they approached the ragged remnants of the thick forest, they angled west and north passing through patches of death and life in solemn silence. No child of the forest, but more friendly to it now, Gimli's heart went out to the woods and his woodsman friend. \"I'm sorry, lad, it seems quite bare, empty of elves and all.\"  \"Not of eyes,\" corrected Legolas plainly, nodding into the tall trees and deep thickets about them. \"We are watched since entering and ever more closely as we deeper delve.\"  Gimli could not decide whether his friend took comfort or caution from that vigilance, but they continued on in silence for a pair of days. They came across occasional signs of battle, and spoke little as they pushed on.  Though spring drew near, its approach was subtle here\u2014where ash had choked and fire had scored. And yet, despite the damage, life was returning though small and scattered. As they pushed further in, Gimli noted that the barrenness of winter and of waste gave way gradually to lusher growth. Yet rather than new life or stalwart old, the forest colors turned to golds, reds and browns. He rightly guessed that Elven presence had been enough to turn both frost and fire from this part of the forest, but could not help but show the twilight of the folk themselves.  After many hours' travel westward on the fourth day, Legolas turned Arod north and soon came into a slight clearing. The clearing opened quickly and stretched into a broad, tree-lined avenue, leading to a riverbridge and beyond it a pair of large stone doors cleft into the very side of a mountain. Before those doors and just across the bridge, a large cohort of elves was collected. Others also dressed in greens and greys, spears in hand or bows on back, spilled out from the trees around them as they continued up the path. Each one stared silently at the new arrivals without expression as even the few forest creatures held their tongues.  Gimli got no indication from his companion on how this bode, and so whispered, \"I trust these are your kin, my friend, or we have survived all else for naught.\"  Legolas gave no response of consolation or alarm, but only brought the horse to an angled stop at the foot of the bridge, horse and elf and dwarf all facing the stonestill party at the other side.  Gimli noted to himself how different were these elves from others he had met in his journeys. More earthy than light, not radiant but neither dull. Their subdued fabrics, lean stature and absolute stillness marked them more extensions of the surrounding trees than the familiar elven earthbound starlight. Unlike his golden-haired companion, nearly all had dark hair, though the pale skin and pointed ears made the kinship clear. These were surely Wood-elves, blood-tied to the forebears of Elrond and Celeborn, but grown closer through the ages to their forest home.  Though he was loath to admit it, most elves looked as alike to Gimli as if ever his two eyes saw the same one twice. (His well-known friend and Lorien's Lady of Light were, of course, excepted.) But among these silent similars, three across the running waters stood out. One, in the center stood a little shorter than the others, weighed down perhaps by the gilded cloak of deep green upon his shoulders and the crown of blossoms and gold upon his head. His thin features, however ageless they be, showed him witness to many years and master to most. Sharp chin held high, he stared at the visitors three, with thumbs hooked in the jeweled belt around his elf-heavy waist. He stood proudly before the open doors, as if waiting for them to make some expected address.  The second, to his right, regarded them sternly from his crisp leather tunic and precisely draped cloak. Though of untellable years as were all elves, this one carried vast experience upon his expression, evidenced both in his stance and the scar across his forehead. Most striking, however, was the souvenir of more recent adventures\u2014his hair was short and grew in mottled patches across his head, like a field of grass renewing unevenly after its winter's sleep. Or after fire. In contrast to the morbid draw of this war gift, a brilliant sword hung at his side and he kept a hand upon its hilt as if daring them to take some unexpected action.  The third elf, standing to their left, was simply dressed and unadorned, in the single-shade brown tunic and grey leggings worn by the majority of the elves about. Though he carried no sword, he had a chest-high shaft of ebony black on which he leaned slightly and fidgeted. His long, dark hair was pulled back from view, while his dark eyes were fixed wide and clearly on Legolas, as if the dwarf, horse and all the others were not present. Gimli had heard of no wizards among elves, as he understood magic to inhabit them all to some degree. Still, he had encountered many unexpected creatures in this past turn of the seasons, and one pale and poled wood-elf held not a candle to the wonders he had already met and bested.  The nobleman, swordsman and staffman, each a different face of elvendom\u2026 Yet they blended with their brethren here in that the face of none gave any clue as to the timber of this reception.  On considering these elves, Gimli realized suddenly how his own companion had held himself more upright, more regal as they had moved nearer this place. Golden hair aside, he matched these folk to be sure, but he carried a particular pride now that he was back among them. Though he had never been called prince among the Fellowship, like Aragorn become Elessar and the Grey become the White, Legolas too had taken on a finer air and surer step upon his return to his rightful place. And yet the greeting for him, for them, did not seem royal or revelrous as had the others. But more troubling than its lack of warmth was the lack of any apparent emotion at all that left Gimli most unsettled as they stood amidst these impenetrable elves.  Without invitation or explanation, Legolas dismounted without disturbing dwarf or horse, and strode confidently to the bridge's center. After a brief pause, the three distinct elves walked out to meet him, the last limping noticeably, though his eyes never wavered as did his gait. Once met, they faced each other\u2014three to one, brown to gold, wood to worldly. Gimli shifted uncomfortably in the saddle, undecided as to whether he ought join his friend and even the odds; but he thought better than to interfere just yet, and kept both his perch and his watch.  Legolas faced the central figure, turned to the swordsman and finally the staffman. Gimli could not see his face, if different expressions he made. But his poise changed not, though he lingered on the last among them. Having acknowledged all, the dwarf-friend looked again to the mighty, middle elf, crossed his hand to his chest, bowed his head and spoke loudly without looking up, \" Suilon a buion, adar-aran n\u00een . I greet and serve, my father-king.\" He sank quickly to one knee before the king confirmed, Thranduil, Lord of the Woodland Realm.  With the gathered host withholding still, the silvan sovereign looked down, reached out his right hand and placed it upon the archer's head. His left hand followed promptly, and he paused a moment, receiving his subject and son. Gradually, a smile and warmth broke across his face, and as his hands withdrew, a circlet of woven vine and gold gleamed around the bowed brow.  Legolas, feeling the release and the remaining presence, instinctively raised one hand to touch the crown and, assured it was in fact there, raised his eyes to his patriarch abruptly, as if disbelieving. The king looked down on him with a rediscovered sorrow, and nodded solemnly. Legolas' head turned to the common councilor at the king's side, whose face ached with consolation. The king cupped his right hand over the kneeling archer's left ear, and Legolas leaned his head into it with gentle grief.  After a moment of absolute silence in the space, the elf-king offered his hands to help Legolas stand and to draw him close for a brief embrace. The swordsman's countenance softened, and the staffman beamed in open joy as Thranduil clasped his son's arms and held him out for a fuller look, his proud smile growing with every homecome inch inspected. He turned Legolas about to face the crowd, commanding, \" Eglerio!  Hail, Legolas Greenleaf, Knight among Men, Ringfellow and Prince of the Woods!\"  The onlooking crowd answered the call in unison, and sank to their knee, smiles breaking now across their suddenly glad faces. Even the king's staffed councilor struggled down, using the carved shaft to lower himself in homage. His eyes, however, he kept fixed still on Legolas, who glanced back to him, an elven blush spreading across his smiling face. Swiftly, the gathered subjects returned to their feet, continuing to cheer their prince welcome, and stepping in toward the bridge, without approaching it too familiarly or the mounted dwarf too closely.  Gimli, once suspicious at the cool welcome and quickly pleased as it turned warm, now started at the suddenly loud and forthpouring crowd of elves around him. That mostly an unfamiliar elvish had been spoken save Legolas' generous self-translation did not help his understanding of the scene before him, nor relieve his ready and nervous axe arm beside him. The dwarf, in turn, startled the horse who had been taking the celebration quite in stride, by standing still at the bridge's edge. \"Legolas!?\" both cried to their companion elf, each in his own way.  The newly crowned prince raised his hand to draw the company's eyes and their silence. Smiling in amusement and pride, he strode to his traveling friends, and stroked Arod calmingly under the chin. For the dwarf, he knew, a different tack. \" Lasto beth n\u00een ,\" he shouted, before continuing in the Common speech as he turned in place to address them all in turn. \"It is good to be home at last, among the trees, my friends and my family again.\" He shot a warm look at the king and his staffman, and faced the royal party for his next statement. \"I am pleased and proud also to return with and introduce my fellow Walker, Gimli, son of Gl\u00f3in, of Erebor.Together we have faced many perils in our quest of the Ring, and I bid you welcome him as I do: good neighbor, strong axe, faithful ally, and fast friend to me, the Greenwood and its good peoples.\"  Gimli, much appeased by the introduction, smiled broadly and waved in anticipation of another round of cheers. He was left to smirk, alas, as the crowd, all save the king and swordsman, bowed their heads to him\u2014a decidedly less tall welcome than his taller friend had received short moments before.  Legolas paid no heed to the restrained receipt of his friend, and motioned Gimli down to follow him. \"Come Gimli, I shall present you to my king and father.\"  Making his most graceful and least noisy dismount, Gimli landed, pulled himself to full height and walked beside the prince's elbows to stand before the royal party. The nobler two regarded him with the non-committal face elves obviously spent their eternity perfecting; the simplest one finally split some glowing attention from Legolas to him\u2014the most approval and curiosity any elf had ever shown him save, again, Legolas and the Lorien Lady.  \"My lords,\" said the prince, \"May I present my  gwador (1)Gimli, son of Gl\u00f3in, warrior of Erebor.\"  Gimli bowed slightly and sincerely, in modesty and greeting, adding his own, accented, \" Mae Govannen .\" The king's eyebrow reared approvingly at the unexpected utterance.  \"Gimli, may I present you to,\" and gestured in turn to each, \"Thranduil Oropherion, King under the Canopy,(2) and Lord of the Woodland Realm.\" Gimli bowed deeply to the sovereign, awed both by stories told him of the king and by his presence here. The king gave only the slightest nod forward, though his expression now held some graciousness.  Next came the swordsman, and \"To Thalind Bellerion, a captain of Mirk- of Eryn Lasgalen.\" The men of the blade nodded to each other smartly and without expression.  Finally Legolas brightened and turned to the staffman, whose odd attire and odder reactions joined the prior introductions to grant Gimli a sudden insight as to his identity. Not waiting to be introduced, he spoke to show his familiarity with his hosts. \"And this must be your elder brother, Arandrandaur, the great warrior of the woods.\"  At his speaking, their expressions fell instantly, and so Gimli adjusted his guessed introduction to be more\u2026 generous. \"\u2026Great alongside your greatnesses, of course?\" He glanced back and forth among them for some glimmer of redemption in their face. He received none.  The staffman swallowed, and broke his silence softly to correct the error. \"Nay, Master Dwarf. Prince Arandrandaur\u2026 fell\u2026 in defense of his homeland against Dol Guldur; you have just seen Legolas made crown prince in his turn.\" He glanced from Gimli to the king, letting his consolation finally rest on Legolas whose crowning shock returned with the spoken confirmation.  Gimli swallowed hard and shuffled in embarrassment and in grief for his friend's family. His look offered his regrets to each, including last the staffman. \"My apologies all, I did not know. For I could not think at first of whom else might stand beside the king and captain. But now I see I have earned your disdain with my hasty words.\" Needing much to right his wrong, he volunteered another name from Legolas' stories likely to be among this important greeting party. \"May you then be the good friend, of whom Legolas sang at times? Are you Melethnin?\"  Again the faces around him held no release, though Legolas' eyes gaped openly in shock at this utterance.  And again, it was the staffman called, who broke the stony stares to smile and laugh, \"You are brave indeed, sir dwarf, to guess a stranger in the presence of sire and soldier and, guessing wrongly, to try again so amusingly.\" Smiling broadly behind closed lips, he raised his eyebrows and looked to Legolas for confirmation for his last points. \"I hope that it was I of whom our young prince sang, for I am indeed his  meleth n\u00een , his own love. But my name\u2026 is Iavasulad.\"(3) The elf stood tall against his staff, reached out and took Legolas' hand in his.  Gimli gaped at his second mistake, and grumbled reproach to himself. His having broken the heavy moment he had created, the others broke into laughter, his mistakes washing away in their melodic tides. Legolas placed a re-assuring hand upon his shoulder, and finished his introduction. \"My friend, I present to you my friend and love, whom I call Dunthon.\"  Dunthon bowed deeply, balanced between his staff and the strong grip of the archer prince. Gimli took comfort in this return to formality, and returned the gesture for honest respect and humble pardon, his axe at his side. Both stood smiling.  Legolas took the moment to release the dwarf, and swept his  melethron(  4)  into a deep embrace, quick kiss and gentle rest of closed eyes, touching foreheads and wide, serene smiles. Gimli took great joy to see his friend so clearly happy, while the on-looking elfhost stood somewhat shocked by this most un-elven display. Even the expressive Dunthon was surprised at so mortal an outburst of emotion, but feeling the same relief on reuniting, gave in wholly and happily.  Recovering and reacting first, the Elvenking shouted over his son and the scene, \"Make ready, my people, for tonight we feast a Homecoming Welcome to our Ringfellows!\" And with that he turned, gracefully, on his royal heels and was followed back through the cavern doors by Thalind and several assorted elves around. Legolas and Dunthon finally stepped apart as the crowd around broke, still hand in hand.  Dunthon smiled warmly at Gimli, \"Come my new-met old friend, the dinner hour approaches quickly. Let us find you fitting quarters for companion to both Ringbearer and royalty.\""}

Tolkien", "rated": null, "language": "en", "words": 3664, "published": "1937-09-21", "text": ""In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.\nIt had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats\u2014the hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill\n\u2014The Hill, as all the people for many miles round called it\u2014and many little round doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another. No going upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he had whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on the same floor, and indeed on the same passage. The best rooms were all on the left-hand side (going in), for these were the only\nones to have windows, deep-set round windows looking over his garden, and meadows beyond, sloping down to the river.\nThis hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit, and his name was Baggins. The Bagginses had lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind, and people considered them very respectable, not only because most of them were rich, but also because they never had any adventures or did anything unexpected: you could tell what a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking him. This is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure, and found himself doing and saying things altogether unexpected. He may have lost the neighbours\u2019 respect, but he gained\u2014well, you will see whether he gained anything in the end.\nThe mother of our particular hobbit\u2014what is a hobbit? I suppose hobbits need some description nowadays, since they have become rare and shy of the Big People, as they call us. They are (or were) a little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded Dwarves. Hobbits have no beards. There is little or no magic about them, except the ordinary everyday sort which helps them to disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you and me come blundering along, making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off. They are inclined to be fat in the stomach; they dress in bright colours (chiefly green and yellow); wear no shoes, because their feet grow natural leathery soles and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads (which is curly); have long clever brown fingers, good-natured faces, and laugh deep fruity laughs (especially after dinner, which they have twice a day when they can get it). Now you know enough to go on with. As I was saying, the mother of this hobbit \u2014of Bilbo Baggins, that is\u2014was the famous Belladonna Took, one of the three remarkable daughters of the Old Took, head of the hobbits who lived across The Water, the small river that ran at the foot of The Hill. It was often said (in other families) that long ago one of the Took ancestors must have taken a fairy wife. That was, of course, absurd, but certainly there was still something not entirely hobbitlike about them, and once in a while members of the Took-clan would go and have adventures. They discreetly disappeared, and the family hushed it up; but the fact remained that the Tooks were not as respectable as the Bagginses, though they were undoubtedly richer.\nNot that Belladonna Took ever had any adventures after she became Mrs. Bungo Baggins. Bungo, that was Bilbo\u2019s father, built the most luxurious hobbit-hole for her (and partly with her money) that was to be found either under The Hill or over The Hill or across The Water, and there they remained to the end of their days. Still it is probable that Bilbo, her only son, although he looked and behaved exactly like a second edition of his solid and comfortable father, got something a bit queer in his make-up from the Took side, something that only waited for a chance to come out. The chance never arrived, until Bilbo Baggins was grown up, being about fifty years old or so, and living in the beautiful hobbit-hole built by his father, which I have just described for you, until he had in fact apparently settled down immovably.\nBy some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world, when there was less noise and more green, and the hobbits were still numerous and prosperous, and Bilbo Baggins was standing at his door after breakfast smoking an enormous long wooden pipe that reached nearly down to his woolly toes (neatly brushed)\u2014Gandalf came by. Gandalf! If you had heard only a quarter of what I have heard about him, and I have only heard very little of all there is to hear, you would be prepared for any sort of remarkable tale. Tales and adventures sprouted up all over the place wherever he went, in the most extraordinary fashion. He had not been down that way under The Hill for ages and ages, not since his friend the Old Took died, in fact, and the hobbits had almost forgotten what he looked like. He had been away over The Hill and across The Water on businesses of his own since they were all small hobbit-boys and hobbit-girls.\nAll that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff. He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which his long white beard hung down below his waist, and immense black boots.\n\u201cGood Morning!\u201d said Bilbo, and he meant it. The sun was shining, and the grass was very green. But Gandalf looked at him from under long bushy eyebrows that stuck out further than the brim of his shady hat.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he said. \u201cDo you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether I want it or not; or that you feel good this morning; or that it is a morning to be good on?\u201d\n\u201cAll of them at once,\u201d said Bilbo. \u201cAnd a very fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors, into the bargain. If you have a pipe about you, sit down and have a fill of mine! There\u2019s no hurry, we have all the day before us!\u201d Then Bilbo sat down on a seat by his door, crossed his legs, and blew out a beautiful grey ring of smoke that sailed up into the air without breaking and floated away over The Hill.\n\u201cVery pretty!\u201d said Gandalf. \u201cBut I have no time to blow smoke-rings this morning. I am looking for someone to share in an adventure that I am arranging, and it\u2019s very difficult to find anyone.\u201d\n\u201cI should think so\u2014in these parts! We are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner! I can\u2019t think what anybody sees in them,\u201d said our Mr. Baggins, and stuck one thumb behind his braces, and blew out another even bigger smoke-ring. Then he took out his morning letters, and began to read, pretending to take no more notice of the old man. He had decided that he was not quite his sort, and wanted him to go away. But the old man did not move. He stood leaning on his stick and gazing at the hobbit without saying anything, till Bilbo got quite uncomfortable and even a little cross.\n\u201cGood morning!\u201d he said at last. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any adventures here, thank you! You might try over The Hill or across The Water.\u201d By this he meant that the conversation was at an end.\n\u201cWhat a lot of things you do use Good morning for!\u201d said Gandalf. \u201cNow you mean that you want to get rid of me, and that it won\u2019t be good till I move off.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all, not at all, my dear sir! Let me see, I don\u2019t think I know your name?\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes, my dear sir\u2014and I do know your name, Mr. Bilbo Baggins. And you do know my name, though you don\u2019t remember that I belong to it. I am Gandalf, and Gandalf means me! To think that I should have lived to be goodmorninged by Belladonna Took\u2019s son, as if I was selling buttons at the door!\u201d\n\u201cGandalf, Gandalf! Good gracious me! Not the wandering wizard that gave Old Took a pair of magic diamond studs that fastened themselves and never came undone till ordered? Not the fellow who used to tell such wonderful tales at parties, about dragons and goblins and giants and the rescue of princesses and the unexpected luck of widows\u2019 sons? Not the man that used to make such particularly excellent fireworks! I remember those! Old Took used to have them on Midsummer\u2019s Eve. Splendid! They used to go up like great lilies and snapdragons and laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all evening!\u201d You will notice already that Mr. Baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to believe, also that he was very fond of flowers. \u201cDear me!\u201d he went on. \u201cNot the Gandalf who was responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for mad adventures? Anything from climbing trees to visiting elves\u2014or sailing in ships, sailing to other shores! Bless me, life used to be quite inter\u2014I mean, you used to upset things badly in these parts once upon a time. I beg your pardon, but I had no idea you were still in business.\u201d\n\u201cWhere else should I be?\u201d said the wizard. \u201cAll the same I am pleased to find you remember something about me. You seem to remember my fireworks kindly, at any rate, and that is not without hope. Indeed for your old grandfather Took\u2019s sake, and for the sake of\npoor Belladonna, I will give you what you asked for.\u201d\n\u201cI beg your pardon, I haven\u2019t asked for anything!\u201d\n\u201cYes, you have! Twice now. My pardon. I give it you. In fact I will go so far as to send you on this adventure. Very amusing for me, very good for you\u2014and profitable too, very likely, if you ever get over it.\u201d\n\u201cSorry! I don\u2019t want any adventures, thank you. Not today. Good morning! But please come to tea\u2014any time you like! Why not tomorrow? Come tomorrow! Good bye!\u201d With that the hobbit turned and scuttled inside his round green door, and shut it as quickly as he dared, not to seem rude. Wizards after all are wizards.\n\u201cWhat on earth did I ask him to tea for!\u201d he said to himself, as he went to the pantry. He had only just had breakfast, but he thought a cake or two and a drink of something would do him good after his fright.\nGandalf in the meantime was still standing outside the door, and laughing long but quietly. After a while he stepped up, and with the spike on his staff scratched a queer sign on the hobbit\u2019s beautiful green front-door. Then he strode away, just about the time when Bilbo was finishing his second cake and beginning to think that he had escaped adventures very well.\nThe next day he had almost forgotten about Gandalf. He did not remember things very well, unless he put them down on his Engagement Tablet: like this: Gandalf Tea Wednesday. Yesterday he had been too flustered to do anything of the kind.\nJust before tea-time there came a tremendous ring on the front-door bell, and then he remembered! He rushed and put on the kettle, and put out another cup and saucer, and an extra cake or two, and ran to the door.\n\u201cI am so sorry to keep you waiting!\u201d he was going to say, when he saw that it was not Gandalf at all. It was a dwarf with a blue beard tucked into a golden belt, and very bright eyes under his dark-green hood. As soon as the door was opened, he pushed inside, just as if he had been expected.\nHe hung his hooded cloak on the nearest peg, and \u201cDwalin at your service!\u201d he said with a low bow.\n\u201cBilbo Baggins at yours!\u201d said the hobbit, too surprised to ask any questions for the moment. When the silence that followed had become uncomfortable, he added: \u201cI am just about to take tea; pray come and have some with me.\u201d A little stiff perhaps, but he meant it kindly. And what would you do, if an uninvited dwarf came and hung his things up in your hall without a word of explanation?\nThey had not been at table long, in fact they had hardly reached the third cake, when there came another even louder ring at the bell.\n\u201cExcuse me!\u201d said the hobbit, and off he went to the door.\n\u201cSo you have got here at last!\u201d That was what he was going to say to Gandalf this time. But it was not Gandalf. Instead there was a very old-looking dwarf on the step with a white beard and a scarlet hood; and he too hopped inside as soon as the door was open, just as if he had been invited.\n\u201cI see they have begun to arrive already,\u201d he said when he caught sight of Dwalin\u2019s green hood hanging up. He hung his red one next to it, and \u201cBalin at your service!\u201d he said with his hand on his breast.\n\u201cThank you!\u201d said Bilbo with a gasp. It was not the correct thing to say, but they have begun to arrive had flustered him badly. He liked visitors, but he liked to know them before they arrived, and he preferred to ask them himself. He had a horrible thought that the cakes might run short, and then he\u2014as the host: he knew his duty and stuck to it however painful\u2014he might have to go without.\n\u201cCome along in, and have some tea!\u201d he managed to say after taking a deep breath.\n\u201cA little beer would suit me better, if it is all the same to you, my good sir,\u201d said Balin with the white beard. \u201cBut I don\u2019t mind some cake\u2014 seed-cake, if you have any.\u201d\n\u201cLots!\u201d Bilbo found himself answering, to his own surprise; and he found himself scuttling off, too, to the cellar to fill a pint beer-mug, and then to a pantry to fetch two beautiful round seedcakes which he had baked that afternoon for his after-supper morsel.\nWhen he got back Balin and Dwalin were talking at the table like old friends (as a matter of fact they were brothers). Bilbo plumped down the beer and the cake in front of them, when loud came a ring at the bell again, and then another ring.\n\u201cGandalf for certain this time,\u201d he thought as he puffed along the passage. But it was not. It was two more dwarves, both with blue hoods, silver belts, and yellow beards; and each of them carried a bag of tools and a spade. In they hopped, as soon as the door began to open\u2014 Bilbo was hardly surprised at all.\n\u201cWhat can I do for you, my dwarves?\u201d he said.\n\u201cKili at your service!\u201d said the one. \u201cAnd Fili!\u201d added the other; and they both swept off their blue hoods and bowed.\n\u201cAt yours and your family\u2019s!\u201d replied Bilbo, remembering his manners this time.\n\u201cDwalin and Balin here already, I see,\u201d said Kili. \u201cLet us join the throng!\u201d\n\u201cThrong!\u201d thought Mr. Baggins. \u201cI don\u2019t like the sound of that. I really must sit down for a minute and collect my wits, and have a drink.\u201d He had only just had a sip\u2014in the corner, while the four dwarves sat round the table, and talked about mines and gold and troubles with the goblins, and the depredations of dragons, and lots of other things which he did not understand, and did not want to, for they sounded much too adventurous\u2014when, ding-dong-a-ling-dang, his bell rang again, as if some naughty little hobbit-boy was trying to pull the handle off.\n\u201cSomeone at the door!\u201d he said, blinking.\n\u201cSome four, I should say by the sound,\u201d said Fili. \u201cBesides, we saw them coming along behind us in the distance.\u201d\nThe poor little hobbit sat down in the hall and put his head in his hands, and wondered what had happened, and what was going to happen, and whether they would all stay to supper. Then the bell rang again louder than ever, and he had to run to the door. It was not four after all, it was five. Another dwarf had come along while he was wondering in the hall. He had hardly turned the knob, before they were all inside, bowing and saying \u201cat your service\u201d one after another. Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, and Gloin were their names; and very soon two purple hoods, a grey hood, a brown hood, and a white hood were hanging on the pegs, and off they marched with their broad hands stuck in their gold and silver belts to join the others. Already it had almost become a throng. Some called for ale, and some for porter, and one for coffee, and all of them for cakes; so the hobbit was kept very busy for a while.\nA big jug of coffee had just been set in the hearth, the seed-cakes were gone, and the dwarves were starting on a round of buttered scones, when there came\u2014a loud knock. Not a ring, but a hard rat-tat on the hobbit\u2019s beautiful green door. Somebody was banging with a stick!\nBilbo rushed along the passage, very angry, and altogether bewildered and bewuthered\u2014 this was the most awkward Wednesday he ever remembered. He pulled open the door with a jerk, and they all fell in, one on top of the other.\nMore dwarves, four more! And there was Gandalf behind, leaning on his staff and laughing. He had made quite a dent on the beautiful door; he had also, by the way, knocked out the secret mark that he had put there the morning before.\n\u201cCarefully! Carefully!\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not like you, Bilbo, to keep friends waiting on the mat, and then open the door like a pop-gun! Let me introduce Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and especially Thorin!\u201d\n\u201cAt your service!\u201d said Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur standing in a row. Then they hung up two yellow hoods and a pale green one; and also a sky-blue one with a long silver tassel.\nThis last belonged to Thorin, an enormously important dwarf, in fact no other than the great Thorin Oakenshield himself, who was not at all pleased at falling flat on Bilbo\u2019s mat with Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur on top of him. For one thing Bombur was immensely fat and heavy. Thorin indeed was very haughty, and said nothing about service; but poor Mr. Baggins said he was sorry so many times, that at last he grunted \u201cpray don\u2019t mention it,\u201d and stopped frowning.\n\u201cNow we are all here!\u201d said Gandalf, looking at the row of thirteen hoods\u2014the best detachable party hoods\u2014and his own hat hanging on the pegs. \u201cQuite a merry gathering! I hope there is something left for the late-comers\nto eat and drink! What\u2019s that? Tea! No thank you! A little red wine, I think for me.\u201d \u201cAnd for me,\u201d said Thorin.\n\u201cAnd raspberry jam and apple-tart,\u201d said Bifur.\n\u201cAnd mince-pies and cheese,\u201d said Bofur.\n\u201cAnd pork-pie and salad,\u201d said Bombur.\n\u201cAnd more cakes\u2014and ale\u2014and coffee, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d called the other dwarves through the door.\n\u201cPut on a few eggs, there\u2019s a good fellow!\u201d Gandalf called after him, as the hobbit stumped off to the pantries. \u201cAnd just bring out the cold chicken and pickles!\u201d\n\u201cSeems to know as much about the inside of my larders as I do myself!\u201d thought Mr. Baggins, who was feeling positively flummoxed, and was beginning to wonder whether a most wretched adventure had not come right into his house. By the time he had got all the bottles and dishes and knives and forks and glasses and plates and spoons and things piled up on big trays, he was getting very hot, and red in the face, and annoyed.\n\u201cConfusticate and bebother these dwarves!\u201d he said aloud. \u201cWhy don\u2019t they come and lend a hand?\u201d Lo and behold! there stood Balin and Dwalin at the door of the kitchen, and Fili and Kili behind them, and before he could say knife they had whisked the trays and a couple of small tables into the parlour and set out everything afresh.\nGandalf sat at the head of the party with the thirteen dwarves all round: and Bilbo sat on a stool at the fireside, nibbling at a biscuit (his appetite was quite taken away), and trying to look as if this was all perfectly ordinary and not in the least an adventure. The dwarves ate and ate, and talked and talked, and time got on. At last they pushed their chairs back, and Bilbo made a move to collect the plates and glasses.\n\u201cI suppose you will all stay to supper?\u201d he said in his politest unpressing tones.\n\u201cOf course!\u201d said Thorin. \u201cAnd after. We shan\u2019t get through the business till late, and we must have some music first. Now to clear up!\u201d"}

Tolkien", "language": "en", "words": 5039, "published": "1954-07-09", "text": "They were just in time. Sam and Frodo were only a few steps up, and Gandalf had just begun to climb, when the groping tentacles writhed across the narrow shore and fingered the cliff-wall and the doors. One came wriggling over the threshold, glistening in the starlight. Gandalf turned and paused. If he was considering what word would close the gate again from within, there was no need. Many coiling arms seized the doors on either side, and with horrible strength, swung them round. With a shattering echo they slammed, and all light was lost. A noise of rending and crashing came dully through the ponderous stone.\n\nSam, clinging to Frodo\u2019s arm, collapsed on a step in the black darkness. \u2018Poor old Bill!\u2019 he said in a choking voice. \u2018Poor old Bill! Wolves and snakes! But the snakes were too much for him. I had to choose, Mr. Frodo. I had to come with you.\u2019\n\nThey heard Gandalf go back down the steps and thrust his staff against the doors. There was a quiver in the stone and the stairs trembled, .but the doors did not open. \u2018Well, well!\u2019 said the wizard. \u2018The passage is blocked behind us now and there is only one way out--on the other side of the mountains. I fear from the sounds that boulders have been piled up, and the trees uprooted and thrown across the gate. I am sorry; for the trees were beautiful, and had stood so long.\u2019\n\n\u2018I felt that something horrible was near from the moment that my foot first touched the water,\u2019 said Frodo.\u2019 What was the thing, or were there many of them? \u2019\n\n\u2018I do not know,\u2019 answered Gandalf,\u2019 but the arms were all guided by one purpose. Something has crept, or has been driven out of dark waters under the mountains. There are older and fouler things than Orcs in the deep places of the world.\u2019 He did not speak aloud his thought that whatever it was that dwelt in the lake, it had seized on Frodo first among all the Company.\n\nBoromir muttered under his breath, but the echoing stone magnified the sound to a hoarse whisper that all could hear: \u2018In the deep places of the world! And thither we are going against my wish. Who will lead us now in this deadly dark? \u2019\n\n\u2018I will,\u2019 said Gandalf,\u2019 and Gimli shall walk with me. Follow my staff!\u2019\n\nAs the wizard passed on ahead up the great steps, he held his staff aloft, and from its tip there came a faint radiance. The wide stairway was sound and undamaged. Two hundred steps they counted, broad and shallow; and at the top they found an arched passage with a level floor leading on into the dark.\n\n\u2018Let us sit and rest and have something to eat, here on the landing, since we can\u2019t find a dining-room!\u2019 said Frodo. He had begun to shake off the terror of the clutching arm, and suddenly he felt extremely hungry.\n\nThe proposal was welcomed by all; and they sat down on the upper steps, dim figures in the gloom. After they had eaten, Gandalf gave them each a third sip of the miruvor of Rivendell.\n\n\u2018It will not last much longer, I am afraid,\u2019 he said;\u2019 but I think we need it after that horror at the gate. And unless we have great luck, we shall need all that is left before we see the other side! Go carefully with the water, too! There are many streams and wells in the Mines, but they should not be touched. We may not have a chance of filling our skins and bottles till we come down into Dimrill Dale.\u2019\n\n\u2018How long is that going to take us?\u2019 asked Frodo.\n\n\u2018I cannot say,\u2019 answered Gandalf.\u2019 It depends on many chances. But going straight, without mishap or losing our way, we shall take three or four marches, I expect. It cannot be less than forty miles from West-door to East-gate in a direct line, and the road may wind much.\u2019\n\nAfter only a brief rest they started on their way again. All were eager to get the journey over as quickly as possible, and were willing, tired as they were, to go on marching still for several hours. Gandalf walked in front as before. In his left hand he held up his glimmering staff, the light of which just showed the ground before his feet; in his right he held his sword Glamdring. Behind him came Gimli, his eyes glinting in the dim light as he turned his head from side to side. Behind the dwarf walked Frodo, and he had drawn the short sword, Sting. No gleam came from the blades of Sting or of Glamdring; and that was some comfort, for being the work of Elvish smiths in the Elder Days these swords shone with a cold light, if any Orcs were near at hand. Behind Frodo went Sam, and after him Legolas, and the young hobbits, and Boromir. In the dark at the rear, grim and silent, walked Aragorn.\n\nThe passage twisted round a few turns, and then began to descend. It went steadily down for a long while before it became level once again. The air grew hot and stifling, but it was not foul, and at times they felt currents of cooler air upon their faces, issuing from half-guessed openings in the walls. There were many of these. In the pale ray of the wizard\u2019s staff, Frodo caught glimpses of stairs and arches and of other passages and tunnels, sloping up, or running steeply down, or opening blankly dark on either side. It was bewildering beyond hope of remembering.\n\nGimli aided Gandalf very little, except by his stout courage. At least he was not, as were most of the others, troubled by the mere darkness in itself. Often the wizard consulted him at points where the choice of way was doubtful; but it was always Gandalf who had the final word. The Mines of Moria were vast and intricate beyond the imagination of Gimli, Gl\u00f3in\u2019s son, dwarf of the mountain-race though he was. To Gandalf the far-off memories of a journey long before were now of little help, but even in the gloom and despite all windings of the road he knew whither he wished to go, and he did not falter, as long as there was a path that led towards his goal.\n\n\u2018Do not be afraid!\u2019 said Aragorn. There was a pause longer than usual, and Gandalf and Gimli were whispering together; the others were crowded behind, waiting anxiously. \u2018Do not be afraid! I have been with him on many a journey, if never on one so dark; and there are tales of Rivendell of greater deeds of his than any that I have seen. He will not go astray-if there is any path to find. He has led us in here against our fears, but he will lead us out again, at whatever cost to himself. He is surer of finding the way home in a blind night than the cats of Queen Ber\u00fathiel.\u2019\n\nIt was well for the Company that they had such a guide. They had no fuel nor any means of making torches; in the desperate scramble at the doors many things had been left behind. But without any light they would soon have come to grief. There were not only many roads to choose from, there were also in many places holes and pitfalls, and dark wells beside the path in which their passing feet echoed. There were fissures and chasms in the walls and floor, and every now and then a crack would open right before their feet. The widest was more than seven feet across, and it was long before Pippin could summon enough courage to leap over the dreadful gap. The noise of churning water came up from far below, as if some great mill-wheel was turning in the depths.\n\n\u2018Rope!\u2019 muttered Sam. \u2018I knew I\u2019 d want it, if I hadn\u2019t got it!\u2019\n\nAs these dangers became more frequent their march became slower. Already they seemed to have been tramping on, on, endlessly to the mountains\u2019 roots. They were more than weary, and yet there seemed no comfort in the thought of halting anywhere. Frodo\u2019s spirits had risen for a while after his escape, and after food and a draught of the cordial; but now a deep uneasiness, growing to dread, crept over him again. Though he had been healed in Rivendell of the knife-stroke, that grim wound had not been without effect. His senses were sharper and more aware of things that could not be seen. One sign of change that he soon had noticed was that he could see more in the dark than any of his companions, save perhaps Gandalf. And he was in any case the bearer of the Ring: it hung upon its chain against his breast, and at whiles it seemed a heavy weight. He felt the certainty of evil ahead and of evil following; but he said nothing. He gripped tighter on the hilt of his sword and went on doggedly.\n\nThe Company behind him spoke seldom, and then only in hurried whispers. There was no sound but the sound of their own feet; the dull stump of Gimli\u2019 s dwarf-boots; the heavy tread of Boromir; the light step of Legolas; the soft, scarce-heard patter of hobbit-feet; and in the rear the slow firm footfalls of Aragorn with his long stride. When they halted for a moment they heard nothing at all, unless it were occasionally a faint trickle and drip of unseen water. Yet Frodo began to hear, or to imagine that he heard, something else: like the faint fall of soft bare feet. It was never loud enough, or near enough, for him to feel certain that he heard it; but once it had started it never stopped, while the Company was moving. But it was not an echo, for when they halted it pattered on for a little all by itself, and then grew still.\n\nIt was after nightfall when they had entered the Mines. They had been going for several hours with only brief halts, when Gandalf came to his first serious check. Before him stood a wide dark arch opening into three passages: all led in the same general direction, eastwards; but the left-hand passage plunged down, while the right-hand climbed up, and the middle way seemed to run on, smooth and level but very narrow.\n\n\u2018I have no memory of this place at all!\u2019 said Gandalf, standing uncertainly under the arch. He held up his staff in the hope of finding some marks or inscription that might help his choice; but nothing of the kind was to be seen. \u2018I am too weary to decide,\u2019 he said, shaking his head. \u2018And I expect that you are all as weary as I am, or wearier. We had better halt here for what is left of the night. You know what I mean! In here it is ever dark; but outside the late Moon is riding westward and the middle-night has passed.\u2019\n\n\u2018Poor old Bill!\u2019 said Sam.\u2019 I wonder where he is. I hope those wolves haven\u2019t got him yet.\u2019\n\nTo the left of the great arch they found a stone door: it was half closed, but swung back easily to a gentle thrust. Beyond there seemed to lie a wide chamber cut in the rock.\n\n\u2018Steady! Steady!\u2019 cried Gandalf as Merry and Pippin pushed forward, glad to find a place where they could rest with at least more feeling of shelter than in the open passage. \u2018Steady! You do not know what is inside yet. I will go first.\u2019\n\nHe went in cautiously, and the others filed behind. \u2018There!\u2019 he said, pointing with his staff to the middle of the floor. Before his feet they saw a large round hole like the mouth of a well. Broken and rusty chains lay at the edge and trailed down into the black pit. Fragments of stone lay near.\n\n\u2018One of you might have fallen in and still be wondering when you were going to strike the bottom,\u2019 said Aragorn to Merry.\u2019 Let the guide go first while you have one.\u2019\n\n\u2018This seems to have been a guardroom, made for the watching of the three passages,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018That hole was plainly a well for the guards\u2019 use, covered with a stone lid. But the lid is broken, and we must all take care in the dark.\u2019\n\nPippin felt curiously attracted by the well. While the others were unrolling blankets and making beds against the walls of the chamber, as far as possible from the hole in the floor, he crept to the edge and peered over. A chill air seemed to strike his face, rising from invisible depths. Moved by a sudden impulse he groped for a loose stone, and let it drop. He felt his heart beat many times before there was any sound. Then far below, as if the stone had fallen into deep water in some cavernous place, there came a plunk, very distant, but magnified and repeated in the hollow shaft.\n\n\u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 cried Gandalf. He was relieved when Pippin confessed what he had done; but he was angry, and Pippin could see his eye glinting.\u2019 Fool of a Took!\u2019 he growled.\u2019 This is a serious journey, not a hobbit walking-party. Throw yourself in next time, and then you will be no further nuisance. Now be quiet!\u2019\n\nNothing more was heard for several minutes; but then there came out of the depths faint knocks: tom-tap, tap-tom. They stopped, and when the echoes had died away, they were repeated: tap-tom, tom-tap, tap-tap, tom. They sounded disquietingly like signals of some sort; but after a while the knocking died away and was not heard again.\n\n\u2018That was the sound of a hammer, or I have never heard one,\u2019 said Gimli.\n\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Gandalf,\u2019 and I do not like it. It may have nothing to do with Peregrin\u2019s foolish stone; but probably something has been disturbed that would have been better left quiet. Pray, do nothing of the kind again! Let us hope we shall get some rest without further trouble. You, Pippin, can go on the first watch, as a reward,\u2019 he growled, as he rolled himself in a blanket.\n\nPippin sat miserably by the door in the pitch dark; but he kept on turning round, fearing that some unknown thing would crawl up out of the well. He wished he could cover the hole, if only with a blanket, but he dared not move or go near it, even though Gandalf seemed to be asleep.\n\nActually Gandalf was awake, though lying still and silent. He was deep in thought, trying to recall every memory of his former journey in the Mines, and considering anxiously the next course that he should take; a false turn now might be disastrous. After an hour he rose up and came over to Pippin.\n\n\u2018Get into a corner and have a sleep, my lad,\u2019 he said in a kindly tone.\u2019 You want to sleep, I expect. I cannot get a wink, so I may as well do the watching.\u2019\n\n\u2018I know what is the matter with me,\u2019 he muttered, as he sat down by the door. \u2019 I need smoke! I have not tasted it since the morning before the snowstorm.\u2019\n\nThe last thing that Pippin saw, as sleep took him, was a dark glimpse of the old wizard huddled on the floor, shielding a glowing chip in his gnarled hands between his knees. The flicker for a moment showed his sharp nose. and the puff of smoke.\n\nIt was Gandalf who roused them all from sleep. He had sat and watched all alone for about six hours, and had let the others rest. \u2018And in the watches I have made up my mind,\u2019 he said. \u2018I do not like the feel of the middle way; and I do not like the smell of the left-hand way: there is foul air down there, or I am no guide. I shall take the right-hand passage. It is time we began to climb up again.\u2019\n\nFor eight dark hours, not counting two brief halts, they marched on; and they met no danger, and heard nothing, and saw nothing but the faint gleam of the wizard\u2019s light, bobbing like a will-o\u2019-the-wisp in front of them. The passage they had chosen wound steadily upwards. As far as they could judge it went in great mounting curves, and as it rose it grew loftier and wider. There were now no openings to other galleries or tunnels on either side, and the floor was level and sound, without pits or cracks. Evidently they had struck what once had been an important road; and they went forward quicker than they had done on their first march.\n\nIn this way they advanced some fifteen miles, measured in a direct line east, though they must have actually walked twenty miles or more. As the road climbed upwards\u2018 Frodo\u2019s spirits rose a little; but he still felt oppressed, and still at times he heard, or thought he heard, away behind the Company and beyond the fall and patter of their feet, a following footstep that was not an echo.\n\nThey had marched as far as the hobbits could endure without a rest, and all were thinking of a place where they could sleep, when suddenly the walls to right and left vanished. They seemed to have passed through some arched doorway into a black and empty space. There was a great draught of warmer air behind them, and before them the darkness was cold on their faces. They halted and crowded anxiously together.\n\nGandalf seemed pleased. \u2018I chose the right way,\u2019 he said. \u2018At last we are coming to the habitable parts, and I guess that we are not far now from the eastern side. But we are high up, a good deal higher than the Dimrill Gate, unless I am mistaken. From the feeling of the air we must be in a wide hall. I will now risk a little real light.\u2019\n\nHe raised his staff, and for a brief instant there was blaze like a flash of lightning. Great shadows sprang up and fled, and for a second they saw a vast roof far above their heads upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of stone. Before them and on either side stretched a huge empty hall; its black walls, polished and smooth as glass, flashed and glittered. Three other entrances they saw, dark black arches: one straight before them eastwards, and one on either side. Then the light went out.\n\n\u2018That is all that I shall venture on for the present,\u2019 said Gandalf.\u2019 There used to be great windows on the mountain-side, and shafts leading out to the light in the upper reaches of the Mines. I think we have reached them now, but it is night outside again, and we cannot tell until morning. If I am right, tomorrow we may actually see the morning peeping in. But in the meanwhile we had better go no further. Let us rest, if we can. Things have gone well so far, and the greater part of the dark road is over. But we are not through yet, and it is a long way down to the Gates that open on the world.\u2019\n\nThe Company spent that night in the great cavernous hall, huddled close together in a corner to escape the draught: there seemed to be a steady inflow of chill air through the eastern archway. All about them as they lay hung the darkness, hollow and immense, and they were oppressed by the loneliness and vastness of the dolven halls and endlessly branching stairs and passages. The wildest imaginings that dark rumour had ever suggested to the hobbits fell altogether short of the actual dread and wonder of Moria.\n\n\u2018There must have been a mighty crowd of dwarves here at one time\u2019 said Sam; \u2018and every one of them busier than badgers for five hundred years to make all this, and most in hard rock too! What did they do it all for? They didn\u2019t live in these darksome holes surely?\u2019\n\n\u2018These are not holes,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018This is the great realm and city of the Dwarrowdelf. And of old it was not darksome, but full of light and splendour, as is still remembered in our songs.\u2019\n\nHe rose and standing in the dark he began to chant in a deep voice, while the echoes ran away into the roof.\n\nThe world was young, the mountains green,\n\nNo stain yet on the Moon was seen,\n\nNo words were laid on stream or stone\n\nWhen Durin woke and walked alone.\n\nHe named the nameless hills and dells;\n\nHe drank from yet untasted wells;\n\nHe stooped and looked in Mirrormere,\n\nAnd saw a crown of stars appear,\n\nAs gems upon a silver thread,\n\nAbove the shadow of his head.\n\nThe world was fair, the mountains tall,\n\nIn Elder Days before the fall\n\nOf mighty kings in Nargothrond\n\nAnd Gondolin, who now beyond\n\nThe Western Seas have passed away:\n\nThe world was fair in Durin\u2019s Day.\n\nA king he was on carven throne\n\nIn many-pillared halls of stone\n\nWith golden roof and silver floor,\n\nAnd runes of power upon the door.\n\nThe light of sun and star and moon\n\nIn shining lamps of crystal hewn\n\nUndimmed by cloud or shade of night\n\nThere shone for ever fair and bright.\n\nThere hammer on the anvil smote,\n\nThere chisel clove, and graver wrote;\n\nThere forged was blade, and bound was hilt;\n\nThe delver mined, the mason built.\n\nThere beryl, pearl, and opal pale,\n\nAnd metal wrought like fishes\u2019 mail,\n\nBuckler and corslet, axe and sword,\n\nAnd shining spears were laid in hoard.\n\nUnwearied then were Durin\u2019s folk\n\nBeneath the mountains music woke:\n\nThe harpers harped, the minstrels sang,\n\nAnd at the gates the trumpets rang.\n\nThe world is grey, the mountains old,\n\nThe forge\u2019s fire is ashen-cold\n\nNo harp is wrung, no hammer falls:\n\nThe darkness dwells in Durin\u2019s halls\n\nThe shadow lies upon his tomb\n\nIn Moria, in Khazad-d\u00fbm.\n\nBut still the sunken stars appear\n\nIn dark and windless Mirrormere;\n\nThere lies his crown in water deep,\n\nTill Durin wakes again from sleep.\n\n\u2018I like that!\u2019 said Sam. \u2018I should like to learn it. In Moria, in Khazad-d\u00fbm! But it makes the darkness seem heavier, thinking of all those lamps. Are there piles of jewels and gold lying about here still?\u2019\n\nGimli was silent. Having sung his song he would say no more.\n\n\u2018Piles of jewels?\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018No. The Orcs have often plundered Moria; there is nothing left in the upper halls. And since the dwarves fled, no one dares to seek the shafts and treasuries down in the deep places: they are drowned in water--or in a shadow of fear.\u2019\n\n\u2018Then what do the dwarves want to come back for?\u2019 asked Sam.\n\n\u2018For mithril,\u2019 answered Gandalf. \u2018The wealth of Moria was not in gold and jewels, the toys of the Dwarves; nor in iron, their servant. Such things they found here, it is true, especially iron; but they did not need to delve for them: all things that they desired they could obtain in traffic. For here alone in the world was found Moria-silver, or true-silver as some have called it: mithril is the Elvish name. The Dwarves have a name which they do not tell. Its worth was ten times that of gold, and now it is beyond price; for little is left above ground, and even the Orcs dare not delve here for it. The lodes lead away north towards Caradhras, and down to darkness. The Dwarves tell no tale; but even as mithril was the foundation of their wealth, so also it was their destruction: they delved too greedily and too deep, and disturbed that from which they fled, Durin\u2019s Bane. Of what they brought to light the Orcs have gathered nearly all, and given it in tribute to Sauron, who covets it.\n\n\u2018Mithril! All folk desired it. It could be beaten like copper, and polished like glass; and the Dwarves could make of it a metal, light and yet harder than tempered steel. Its beauty was like to that of common silver, but the beauty of mithril did not tarnish or grow dim. The Elves dearly loved it, and among many uses they made of it ithildin, starmoon, which you saw upon the doors. Bilbo had a corslet of mithril-rings that Thorin gave him. I wonder what has become of it? Gathering dust still in Michel Delving Mathom-house, I suppose.\u2019\n\n\u2018What?\u2019 cried Gimli, startled out of his silence. \u2018A corslet of Moria-silver? That was a kingly gift!\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018I never told him, but its worth was greater than the value of the whole Shire and everything in it.\u2019\n\nFrodo said nothing, but he put his hand under his tunic and touched the rings of his mail-shirt. He felt staggered to think that he had been walking about with the price of the Shire under his jacket. Had Bilbo known? He felt no doubt that Bilbo knew quite well. It was indeed a kingly gift. But now his thoughts had been carried away from the dark Mines, to Rivendell, to Bilbo, and to Bag End in the days while Bilbo was still there. He wished with all his heart that he was back there, and in those days, mowing the lawn, or pottering among the flowers, and that he had never heard of Moria, or mithril -or the Ring.\n\nA deep silence fell. One by one the others fell asleep. Frodo was on guard. As if it were a breath that came in through unseen doors out of deep places, dread came over him. His hands were cold and his brow damp. He listened. All his mind was given to listening and nothing else for two slow hours; but he heard no sound, not even the imagined echo of a footfall.\n\nHis watch was nearly over, when, far off where he guessed that the western archway stood, he fancied that he could see two pale points of light, almost like luminous eyes. He started. His head had nodded. \u2018I must have nearly fallen asleep on guard,\u2019 he thought. \u2018I was on the edge of a dream.\u2019 He stood up and rubbed his eyes, and remained standing, peering into the dark, until he was relieved by Legolas.\n\nWhen he lay down he quickly went to sleep, but it seemed to him that the dream went on: he heard whispers, and saw the two pale points of light approaching, slowly. He woke and found that the others were speaking softly near him, and that a dim light was falling on his face. High up above the eastern archway through a shaft near the roof came a long pale gleam; and across the hall through the northern arch light also glimmered faint and distantly.\n\nFrodo sat up. \u2018Good morning!\u2019 said Gandalf: \u2018For morning it is again at last. I was right, you see. We are high up on the east side of Moria. Before today is over we ought to find the Great Gates and see the waters of Mirrormere lying in the Dimrill Dale before us.\u2019\n\n\u2018I shall be glad,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018I have looked on Moria, and it is very great, but it has become dark and dreadful; and we have found no sign of my kindred. I doubt now that Balin ever came here.\u2019\n\nAfter they had breakfasted Gandalf decided to go on again at once. \u2018We are tired, but we shall rest better when we are outside,\u2019 he said. \u2018I think that none of us will wish to spend another night in Moria.\u2019\n\n\u2018No indeed!\u2019 said Boromir. \u2018Which way shall we take? Yonder eastward arch?\u2019\n\n\u2018Maybe,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018But I do not know yet exactly where we are. Unless I am quite astray, I guess that we are above and to the north of the Great Gates; and it may not be easy to find the right road down to them. The eastern arch will probably prove to be the way that we must take; but before we make up our minds we ought to look about us. Let us go towards that light in the north door. If we could find a window it would help, but I fear that the light comes only down deep shafts.\u2019\n\nFollowing his lead the Company passed under the northern arch. They found themselves in a wide corridor. As they went along it the glimmer grew stronger, and they saw that it came through a doorway on their right. It was high and flat-topped, and the stone door was still upon its hinges, standing half open. Beyond it was a large square chamber. It was dimly lit, but to their eyes, after so long a time in the dark, it seemed dazzlingly bright, and they blinked as they entered.\n\nTheir feet disturbed a deep dust upon the floor, and stumbled among things lying in the doorway whose shapes they could not at first make out. The chamber was lit by a wide shaft high in the further eastern wall; it slanted upwards and, far above, a small square patch of blue sky could be seen. The light of the shaft fell directly on a table in the middle of the room: a single oblong block, about two feet high, upon which was laid a great slab of white stone.\n\n\u2018It looks like a tomb,\u2019 muttered Frodo, and bent forwards with a curious sense of foreboding, to look more closely at it. Gandalf came quickly to his side. On the slab runes were deeply graven:\n\n\u2018These are Daeron\u2019s Runes, such as were used of old in Moria,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2019 Here is written in the tongues of Men and Dwarves:\n\nbalin son of fundin\n\nlord of moria.\u2019\n\n\u2018He is dead then,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018I feared it was so.\u2019 Gimli cast his hood over his face."}

Tolkien", "language": "en", "words": 1740, "published": "1977-01-01", "text": "Now the Three Kindreds of the Eldar were gathered at last in Valinor, and Melkor was chained. This was the\nNoontide of the Blessed Realm, the fullness of its glory and its bliss, long in tale of years, but in memory too brief. In those days the Eldar became full-grown in stature of body and of mind, and the Noldor advanced ever in skill and knowledge; and the long years were filled with their joyful labours, in which many new things fair and wonderful were devised. Then it was that the Noldor first bethought them of letters, and R\u00famil of Tirion was the name of the loremaster who first achieved fitting signs for the recording of speech and song, some for graving upon metal or in stone, others for drawing with brush or with pen.\nIn that time was born in Eldamar, in the house of the King in Tirion upon the crown of T\u00fana, the eldest of the sons of Finw\u00eb, and the most beloved. Curufinw\u00eb was his name, but by his mother he was called F\u00ebanor, Spirit of Fire; and thus he is remembered in all the tales of the Noldor.\nM\u00edriel was the name of his mother, who was called Serind\u00eb, because of her surpassing skill in weaving and needlework; for her hands were more skilled to fineness than any hands even among the Noldor. The love of Finw\u00eb and M\u00edriel was great and glad, for it began in the Blessed Realm in the Days of Bliss. But in the bearing of her son M\u00edriel was consumed in spirit and body; and after his birth she yearned for release from the labours of living. Ana when she had named mm, she said to Finw\u00eb: 'Never again shall I bear child; for strength that would have nourished the life of many has gone forth into F\u00ebanor.'\nThen Finw\u00eb was grieved, for the Noldor were in me youth of their days, and he desired to bring forth many children into the Miss of Aman; and he said: 'Surely there is healing in Aman? Here all weariness can find rest.' But when M\u00edriel languished still, Finw\u00eb sought the counsel of Manw\u00eb, and Manw\u00eb delivered her to the care of Irmo in L\u00f3rien. At their parting (for a little while as he thought) Finw\u00eb was sad, for it seemed an unhappy chance that the mother should depart and miss the beginning at least of the childhood days of her son.\n\u2018It is indeed unhappy,\u2019 said M\u00edriel, 'and I would weep, if I were not so weary. But hold me blameless in this, and in all that may come after.\u2019\nShe went then to the gardens of L\u00f3rien and lay down to sleep; but though she seemed to sleep, her spirit indeed departed from her body, and passed in silence to the halls of Mandos. The maidens of Est\u00eb tended the body of M\u00edriel, and it remained unwithered; but she did not return. Then Finw\u00eb lived in sorrow; and he went often to the gardens of L\u00f3rien, and sitting beneath the silver willows beside the body of his wife he called her by her names. But it was unavailing; and alone in all the Blessed Realm he was deprived of joy. After a while he went to L\u00f3rien no more.\nAn his love he gave thereafter to his son; and F\u00ebanor grew swiftly, as if a secret fire were kindled within him. He was tall, and fair of face, and masterful, his eyes piercingly bright and his hair raven-dark; in the pursuit of all his purposes eager and steadfast. Few ever changed his courses by counsel, none by force. He became of all the Noldor, then or after, the most subtle in mind and the most skilled in hand. In his youth, bettering the work of R\u00famil, he devised those letters which bear his name, and which the Eldar used ever after; and he it was who, first of the Noldor, discovered how gems greater and brighter than those of the earth might be made with skill. The first gems that F\u00ebanor made were white and colourless, but being set under starlight they would blaze with blue and silver fires brighter than Helluin; and other crystals he made also, wherein things far away could be seen small but clear, as with the eyes of the eagles of Manw\u00eb. Seldom were the hands and mind of F\u00ebanor at rest.\nWhile still in his early youth he wedded Nerdanel, the daughter of a great smith named Mahtan, among those of the Noldor most dear to Aul\u00eb; and of Mahtan he learned much of the making of things in metal and in stone. Nerdanel also was firm of will, but more patient than F\u00ebanor, desiring to understand minds rather than to master them, and at first she restrained him when the fire of his heart grew too hot; but his later deeds grieved her, and they became estranged. Seven sons she bore to F\u00ebanor; her mood she bequeathed in part to some of them, but not to all.\nNow it came to pass that Finw\u00eb took as his second wife Indis the Fair. She was a Vanya, close kin of Ingw\u00eb the High King, golden-haired and tall, and in all ways unlike M\u00edriel. Finw\u00eb loved her greatly, and was glad again. But the shadow of M\u00edriel did not depart from the house of Finw\u00eb, nor from his heart; and of all whom he loved F\u00ebanor had ever the chief share of his thought.\nThe wedding of his father was not pleasing to F\u00ebanor; and he had no great love for Indis, nor for Fingolfin and Finarfin, her sons. He lived apart from them, exploring the land of Aman, or busying himself with the knowledge and the crafts in which he delighted. In those unhappy things which later came to pass, and in which F\u00ebanor was the leader, many saw the effect of this breach within the house of Finw\u00eb, judging that if Finw\u00eb had endured his loss and been content with the fathering of his mighty son, the courses of F\u00ebanor would have been otherwise, and great evil might have been prevented; for the sorrow and the strife in the house of Finw\u00eb is graven in the memory of the Noldorin Elves. But the children of Indis were great and glorious, and their children also; and if they had not lived the history of the Eldar would have been diminished.\nNow even while F\u00ebanor and the craftsmen of the Noldor worked with delight, foreseeing no end to their labours, and while the sons of Indis grew to their full stature, the Noontide of Valinor was drawing to its close. For it came to pass that Melkor, as the Valar had decreed, completed the term of his bondage, dwelling for three ages in the duress of Mandos, alone. At length, as Manw\u00eb had promised, he was brought again before the thrones of the Valar. Then he looked upon their glory and their bliss, and envy was in his heart; he looked upon the Children of Il\u00favatar that sat at the feet of the Mighty, and hatred filled him; he looked upon the wealth of bright gems, and he lusted for them; but he hid his thoughts, and postponed his vengeance.\nBefore the gates of Valmar Melkor abased himself at the feet of Manw\u00eb and sued for pardon, vowing that if he might be made only the least of the free people of Valinor he would aid the Valar in all their works, and most of all in the healing of the many hurts that he had done to the world.\nAnd Nienna aided his prayer; but Mandos was silent.\nThen Manw\u00eb granted him pardon; but the Valar would not yet suffer him to depart beyond their sight and vigilance, and he was constrained to dwell within the gates of Valmar. But fair-seeming were all the words and deeds of Melkor in that time, and both the Valar and the Eldar had profit from his aid and counsel, if they sought it; and therefore in a while he was given leave to go freely about the land, and it seemed to Manw\u00eb that the evil of Melkor was cured. For Manw\u00eb was free from evil and could not comprehend it, and he knew that in the beginning, in the thought of Il\u00favatar, Melkor had been even as he; and he saw not to the depths of Melkor\u2019s heart, and did not perceive that all love had departed from him for ever. But Ulmo was not deceived, and Tulkas clenched his hands whenever he saw Melkor his foe go by; for if Tulkas is slow to wrath he is slow also to forget. But they obeyed the judgement of Manw\u00eb; for those who will defend authority against rebellion must not themselves rebel.\nNow in his heart Melkor most hated the Eldar, both because they were fair and joyful and because in them he saw the reason for the arising of the Valar, and his own downfall. Therefore all the more did he feign love for them and seek their friendship, and he offered them the service of his lore and labour in any great deed that they would do. The Vanyar indeed held him in suspicion, for they dwelt in the light of the Trees and were content; and to the Teleri he gave small heed, thinking them of little worth, tools too weak for his designs. But the Noldor took delight in the hidden knowledge that he could reveal to them; and some hearkened to words that it would have been better for them never to have heard. Melkor indeed declared afterwards that F\u00ebanor had learned much art from him in secret, and had been instructed by him in the greatest of all his works; but he lied in his lust and his envy, for none of the Eldali\u00eb ever hated Melkor more than F\u00ebanor son of Finw\u00eb, who first named him Morgoth; and snared though he was in the webs of Melkor's malice against the Valar he held no converse with him and took no counsel from him. For F\u00ebanor was driven by the fire of his own heart only, working ever swiftly and alone; and he asked the aid and sought the counsel of none that dwelt in Aman, great or small, save only and for a little while of Nerdanel the wise, his wife."}
