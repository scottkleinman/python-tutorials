    "You can do some pretty powerful stuff quite easily by copying other people's code, but you'll need to have an idea of what you are looking at when you find examples online.

    "### Programs and Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer programming, there is no clear distinction between a \"program\" and a \"script\". Typically the latter has a smaller, less elaborate code base than the former. In the Digital Humanities, you'll hear about practioners writing scripts to accomplish certain tasks. If the code is an integrated set of functions or is accompanied by a web-based or graphic user interface (GUI), it is more likely to be referred to as a tool. (Sometimes the term \"app\" is used, but the term has not caught on as much in the Digital Humanities.) \n",

    "### Python Packages (Modules)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you use \"functions\" to perform operations. For example, the `print()` function prints whatever message inside the parentheses to the screen. Python has a standard \"library\" of functions (called the standard library) like `print()`, which can be \"called\" out of the box. It is also possible to import libraries of functions, which are called \"packages\" or \"modules\", into your code. These packages are not part of Python; they are more like plugins. Some Python packages like `time` have to be imported; they are not available by default in order to save memory. Other Python packages are designed by third-party contributors. These generally have to be installed in your Python distribution before they can be imported to your script.Python \"distributions\" like Anaconda come with many common third-party packages pre-installed to save you time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a package is available your distribution, you can import it with a command like `import PACKAGE_NAME` (where `PACKAGE_NAME` represents the name of the package). In the example above, we used `from time import sleep`. Instead of importing the whole `time` package, we simply imported the `sleep` function from its library.\n",

In Python, some of the most common types of content are *integers*, *floats*, *strings*, *lists*, and *dictionaries* (also known as \"dicts\"). The data type of any piece of data is defined using delimiter symbols:\n",

    "### Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings contain alphanumeric data &mdash; that is, either numbers or letters, as well as punctuation marks. Strings are delimited either by single or double quotation marks. So  `'hello'` and `\"hello\"` are exactly the same. In this tutorial, single quotation marks will be used for consistency (and also because that is a recommendation of a prominent Python code style guide). Quotation marks inside of apostrophe delimiters will be interpreted as part of the string, as will apostrophes inside quotation mark delimiters. For example, you could encode the sentence *He said, \"We are ready.\"* as `'He said, \"We are ready.\"'`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of gotchas when dealing with strings. First, curly quotes or smart quotes are not interpreted as quotation marks by Python; they will be treated as characters in the string. So be warned if you try to copy code from a document with curly quotes. You are likely to get an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some strings may contain apostrophes or quotation marks that are part of the string, not delimiter symbols. Take, for example, the sentence _We're ready._. Coding this as `'We're ready.'` will generate an error because Python will interpret the second apostrophe as a delimiter, ending the string. An obvious way around this problem is to use double quotation marks as the delimiters: `'We're ready.\"`. That works. But what if you wanted to use the sentence _He said, \"We're ready.\"_? For this sentence you will probably want to use a method called \"escaping\" the ambiguous punctuation mark. In Python, characters like this are normall escaped with a preceding backslash. Here is any easy way to fix the problem: `'He said, \"We\\'re ready.\"'`. The backslash before the apostrophe tells Python not to interpret it as a string delimiter.\n",

Items in lists are stored in a strict order, and each item has an index number. Like most programming languages, Python uses zero-indexing, so the first item in the list will have the index number 0.

    "\n",
    "We've already seen the use of the `print()` and `str()` functions. Now let's explore the concept of a function a little more formally.\n",

    "A function is a command to do something with one of the data types and send back (or \"return\") a result. When functions form part of larger libraries, they are often called \"methods\". Since `print()` and `str()` are part of the standard library, they are often referred to as the `print()` and `str()` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are called by using the name of the function (e.g. `print`) followed by parentheses containing the data to be passed to the function. So `print('Hello world.')` passes \"Hello world.\" to the `print()` function.  The value in parentheses is called the _argument_ or _parameter_. You can use a variable as the argument of a function. For instance, if you defined `my_var = 1`, you could then use `str(my_var)` to convert `1` to a `'1'`. Another example is the `append()` function, which adds an item to the end of a list. For instance, you could add the number 1 to the `my_list` created above: `my_list.append(1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, Python has a set of built-in functions like `str()` and `append()`, and more functions can be imported from packages. However, sometimes you will want to define your own. Functions are defined by using the keyword `def` followed by the name of the function and (generally) one or more variable names to be used for the data that is passed to the function. Here's a small script to show how this is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "append_to_list_and_print(1)\n",
    "```\n",

    "The script starts with an empty list. It then defines a function called `append_to_list_and_print()`. This function combines the actions of appending to the list whatever item is passed to the function and then printing the results. The script then \"calls\" the function twice, first using the name John and then again using the number 1. Inside the function, we don't have to save these values with the variable name `item`; we can call that variable whatever seems like an adequate description of the value being passed to the function.\n",

    "### Introduction to JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll end with a bit of candy to let you play around with the Python `json` module. Imagine you had a web page with a login form, and you wanted to send the username and password to be checked using Python. A common way to do this is by using a programming language that is built into all web browsers called Javascript. It is logical to store the username and password into something like a Python dict that looks like `{'username': 'admin', 'password': '1234'}` (you would never use these values, of course!). In Javascript, this type of structure is called an \"object\". Javascript objects can be cast as strings and then sent to a server running Python, where the strings can be converted to Python dicts. Web applications often send large amounts of data \"serialised\" (converted to one long string) in this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various types of serialisation formats, but a very common one is based on howe Javascript objects are constructed. This is called JSON, which stands for Javascript Object Notation. It looks and behaves pretty much like a Python dict with one major gotcha. Keys and values have to be in double quotation marks. (There are a few other differences as well, but this is the most obvious). So, if we want to send or manipulate data serialised in JSON format, we need to parse it into a Python dict. Likewise, if we want to, for instance, send the material in a Python dict back to the web browers, we first serialise it into JSON format. The use of JSON is common enough in Digital Humanities projects, that I think it is worth bringing it to your attention in a basic tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, the main purpose of using JSON here will simply be to illustrate how to import and use a module that is not part of the standard library. Python has a `json` module that helps us work with JSON. Try running the code below."
